## 3 final steps before we finish
The course is approaching its finish. 
This document describes 3 main steps you should make to complete the shared task, and deadlines for the steps.
Please, pay attention to these since they will heavily influence your grade:

## Step 1. Create README.md for your project
You need to fill in the gaps in the README-EXAMPLE.md template from the materials repo
and publish result README.md file under the GitHub project root.

We do this instead of the project report because this file will turn your efforts during the shared task into a nice looking and organized open source repo,
that you can ~~delete~~ attach to your CV later. 

Some notes about README-EXAMPLE.md:
* leave test set scores and poster link empty for now 
* by "final system" I mean the one you obtained test set translation with 
* there is a section "What we also tried or wanted to try": if you failed to do something due to reasons, 
describe your attempts and intuitions here
     
## Step 2. Translate source side of the test set and publish results  
1. Create a new folder on your team's GitHub repo. The directory should be named "test-final".
2. Translate source side of the test set with your final system, and publish results file under "test_final" folder. 
     Result file should be named "X.hyps.test.en", where X is {A, B, C, D, E, F} depending on your GitHub repo system name.

## Step 3. Create a poster and come to poster session
The plan is to have a poster session for presenting projects. 
Some of you are also enrolled at NLP course this semester, so to be systematic we follow the same guidelines:

Generally speaking, it is up to you what to put on the poster. Feel free to reuse your reports and final README.md

NB0! Forget about deadline tomorrow (see NB1) <br>
NB1! The deadline for Step 1 and Step 2 is December 16, 06:00 AM. <br>
NB2! The poster session will be held on Wednesday, December 20 instead of lecture. Room number TBA.
