the purpose of this report is to descri@@ be the steps to be taken to build a staff management function – to clari@@ fy the P@@ H strategy and operations .
there is currently no investment depar@@ tment P@@ H@@ -@@ function .
the idea of this report s@@ hap@@ ed the D@@ ace Ro@@ z@@ e He@@ ad of D@@ ace in the debate on 22 September .
however , the content of the P@@ h@@ -@@ Plan was also discussed with the le@@ ad@@ ers of other entities : An@@ ita B@@ is@@ of@@ a , Val@@ da Ce@@ pu@@ r and Val@@ dis B@@ is@@ ters .
the Mo@@ e Inves@@ tment De@@ par@@ tment is growing ra@@ pid@@ ly and is fac@@ ed with many changes in the coming years .
possible changes in the depar@@ tment &apos;s organisation are already in consideration .
pressure to deal effectively and correc@@ tly both processes and staff issues are ur@@ gent .
in the current situation , the direc@@ tors and the manag@@ ers of entities are so bus@@ y with projects so that there is no simp@@ ly time to develop P@@ H .
it is very desi@@ rable to ap@@ point a person responsible for P@@ H to concentra@@ te on setting up the Sta@@ ff Management System and will be able to develop it in accordance with practical needs .
before P@@ H planning , the vision of the depar@@ tment and the mission must be clear .
the Inves@@ tment De@@ par@@ tment strategy and shor@@ t-@@ term action plan are recommended to review a year .
E@@ li , the participation of the national programmes should be stres@@ sed in accordance with the actual need .
the number of projects will increase significantly and increas@@ ingly projects reach@@ ing the implementation phase , affec@@ ting the number of workers needed and their compe@@ ten@@ ces .
shor@@ tly , PR@@ K ( the hand@@ book on implementation of the project ) and P@@ K@@ J ( Gu@@ ide to the project organisation ) will be fin@@ alised .
they should be used in this au@@ tu@@ mn .
the PR@@ C shall take account of the requirements of each financing method and descri@@ be the appropriate sub@@ -@@ processes .
these instru@@ ctions shall provide practical sta@@ tu@@ tes for both f@@ low and organisation .
these instru@@ ctions should be based on the following steps such as writing and identi@@ fying the fields of competence .
the measures necessary for the establishment and future practical needs of the staff management system are described in Annex III .
the initial plan for the establishment of the P@@ H@@ D is set out in Annex IV .
the plan would be a pre@@ requ@@ isi@@ te for the Sta@@ ff Man@@ ag@@ er / Co@@ ordin@@ ator to start with a ful@@ l-@@ time work on P@@ H development in December 2003 .
the Director and the He@@ ads of Un@@ it should cooper@@ ate closely with the staff management work@@ er – to inform him of the needs of continu@@ ous development and to put it first .
they are also responsible for the development of development and s@@ co@@ re@@ board discus@@ sions ; the staff management staff contribu@@ tes to discus@@ sions on the moder@@ n@@ isation and data fi@@ les of ch@@ ess .
the le@@ ad@@ ers of entities must also play an active role in developing areas of competence and content .
the self-@@ assessment of the de@@ vices invol@@ ves all person@@ nel .
staff management staff shall coordin@@ ate the assessment of compe@@ ten@@ ces and man@@ age data fi@@ les .
the D@@ ra@@ ft Bud@@ get for the D@@ iv@@ ision 2004 must include both P@@ H development costs ( mainly P@@ H@@ -@@ employe@@ e , mun@@ i@@ ci@@ pal@@ ities , IT staff ) and the cost of training .
the Ex@@ ecu@@ tive expen@@ ses shall consis@@ t of direct costs ( e.g. cour@@ ses , le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , materials ) , te@@ ach@@ ing and training from time to training , training of partici@@ pants in training and training for P@@ H@@ -@@ employe@@ e .
once a year , the cost of the lost working time ar@@ ises from evaluation and P@@ L@@ P inter@@ views .
prior to the provision of any budget fig@@ ures , an approxima@@ te esti@@ mate of the 2004 training activities is required .

in view of the call for the March 2005 Council meeting , L@@ at@@ via has prepared a national Lisbon programme for 2005@@ -@@ 2008 ( here@@ in@@ after ‘ the programme ’ ) , with a view to promoting economic growth and employment .
the programme is a policy planning document which shows how the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the 2005@@ -@@ 2008 Lisbon Strategy are achieved by the Lisbon Strategy in July 2005 .
the programme refle@@ cts the key challenges of the Lisbon Strategy to achieve the objectives of L@@ at@@ via and demonstra@@ tes the main fea@@ tures of these challenges and actions , but also indicators for achieving these objectives .
the programme is based on documents planned for the planned policy planning of the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an Republic .
the programme was designed to coordin@@ ate the Lisbon strategy .
Se@@ im ( L@@ at@@ vi@@ an Parliament ) and the social partners were consul@@ ted .
the programme consis@@ ts of introduc@@ tory part ( ma@@ cro@@ economic policy , micro@@ -@@ economic reforms , employment policy guidelines ) and anne@@ xes .
all nu@@ mer@@ ical information and fig@@ ures received from the Sta@@ tis@@ tical Office of the Republic of L@@ at@@ via , or Euro@@ sta@@ t , except in cases specified specifically .
in order to achieve these objectives , minis@@ tries introduc@@ ing strategic plans with regard to the development of strategic plans for the preparation of the strategic program@@ ming principles based on the principles of the strategic planning , in line with the priorities set by the Gover@@ ning Council , and including their funding and including their funding , including their financing .
to ensure the successful accession of L@@ at@@ via to the euro area ,
adopted the Minis@@ teri@@ al Office on 21 July 2005 , on 21 July 2005 , to establish a European single currency with the tas@@ k of developing the necessary action plan to ensure the successful accession of L@@ at@@ via to the euro area .
on 31 December 2004 , public debt amoun@@ ted to 9@@ 75 million in La@@ tin , 13@@ ,@@ 3 % of GDP .
it is expected that public debt will gradu@@ ally increase in the coming years and can reach 13@@ ,@@ 6 % of GDP in 2008 .
the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an government debt is one of the s@@ mal@@ le@@ st s@@ mal@@ ler and fore@@ see@@ able assu@@ mp@@ tions in the European Union , in the medi@@ um term ( 60 % of GDP ) , as defined in the M@@ aas@@ tri@@ ch@@ t Treaty .
on the basis of the information provided , the current situation in L@@ at@@ via is not ur@@ gent to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt , but before any action is taken in the area of public debt management , it must be ca@@ ref@@ ul@@ ly analy@@ sed to ensure that the country is most favou@@ rable .
the main proposed measures in the area of public debt 2005@@ -@@ 2008 ( Gu@@ ide@@ line 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary resources to finance the de@@ fic@@ it of the public budget and to re@@ financing public debt obligations as minimum costs and as favou@@ rable conditions , li@@ mit@@ ing financial risks and taking into account the development of the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an State market and all financial systems ( responsible : Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance ) :
– to develop new debt re@@ de@@ mption and debt exchange programmes in order to man@@ age debt re@@ financing risks to use the opportunities off@@ ered by the capital market to attra@@ ct long-term resources ;
- In keeping with the reduc@@ tions already started by the foreign debt service , all existing provisions of external credit agreements will be re@@ vie@@ wed in order to assess the re@@ financing of lo@@ ans in the future by re@@ financing those lo@@ ans to other favou@@ rable lo@@ ans , or possible changes to the provisions of the Treaty .
the sustainability of public finan@@ ces in L@@ at@@ via can be assessed posi@@ tively and character@@ ised by rela@@ tively small debt , but also sufficient budgetary dis@@ cip@@ line .
the commitment of L@@ at@@ via to the requirements of the Sta@@ bility and Gro@@ w@@ th P@@ act , as well as the objective of accession to the euro area , is another additional guarantee guarantee for the current budgetary position .
the long-term sustainability of public finan@@ ces is mainly affected by the sustainability of public finan@@ ces , which is the result of the working age population and their share of population in the population and increasing demo@@ gra@@ phic burden .
the initial calcu@@ lation of financial sustainability shows that a@@ ge@@ ing of the population affec@@ ts L@@ at@@ via &apos;s society and the economy and public finan@@ ces , but thanks to the re@@ ti@@ rement reforms that will not result in in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table consequences .
L@@ at@@ via &apos;s small debt and pressure pressure on increasing costs will give the government some flexi@@ bility and maintain the stability of public finan@@ ces .
however , it should be noted that the a@@ ge@@ ing population makes a test in the new way .
the distribution of health costs according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs fall to ol@@ der people whose number is significantly increasing over the next 50 years .
long-term care costs are currently rather small in L@@ at@@ via , which is caused by limited resources from both government and local authorities , but also for society tradi@@ tions and values .
at the same time , the health of other demo@@ gra@@ phic groups should also be ensu@@ red as the overall level of mor@@ bi@@ d@@ ity is high .
the government will develop an effective heal@@ th@@ care system based on long-term perspe@@ ctive .
in order to ada@@ pt significantly to the current demo@@ gra@@ phic situation , changes will be needed in the public finan@@ ces .
in the long term , demo@@ gra@@ phic bur@@ d@@ ens will play a crucial role in improving the growth of the living standard of all popu@@ lations in the population of the population .
it is therefore important to ensure that L@@ at@@ via ’ s main we@@ alth – human training according to labour market dem@@ ands , in order to create an acc@@ es@@ sible labour market ( see section 3 ) .
the overall development of the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an State &apos;s economy will also make a significant contribution to fo@@ rest , as it meet@@ s the requirements of w@@ ood processing , the lar@@ gest export sector in the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an industry .
the fo@@ rest is also an important res@@ ource for rural development , as it provides a living for resid@@ ents working in different areas , 150 000 fo@@ rest ow@@ ners and fo@@ rest@@ ry companies .
the re@@ venu@@ es from the end and r@@ are of the final and r@@ are or services are inves@@ ted in fo@@ rest ow@@ ners in the fo@@ rest storage or continu@@ ous production process .
the lar@@ gest fo@@ rest ow@@ ners ( the country , local authorities and some of the private fir@@ ms to wh@@ om tho@@ us@@ ands of he@@ c@@ ta@@ res are ow@@ ned ) can ensure continu@@ ous production process throughout the long fo@@ rest management cy@@ cle .
having regard to the com@@ position of the t@@ ree , age , structure , previous administrative practice , the economic situation of rural areas , but also the knowledge of fo@@ rest ow@@ ners , is a significant ob@@ sta@@ cle to fo@@ rest@@ ry ow@@ ners .
due to the above circumstances , there is currently insu@@ ffici@@ ent investment in rest@@ oring fo@@ rest value for fo@@ rest in fo@@ rest ( revenue ) ; therefore it is necessary to promote a w@@ oo@@ den produc@@ tivity ( ti@@ mely and high quality of the fo@@ rest , the use of fo@@ rest re@@ produc@@ tive material ) , in particular in private parts .
although L@@ at@@ via &apos;s waste management systems have been supplemen@@ ted and the awareness of society on the need to reduce land@@ f@@ ill is increased , the amount of gar@@ b@@ age caused by each year is increased .
the pos@@ sibilities for gar@@ b@@ age processing and u@@ tilis@@ ation are ina@@ de@@ qu@@ ate , although companies receive subsi@@ dies from the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an environment for environmental har@@ m@@ ful goods and gener@@ ating waste gener@@ ated and gener@@ ated from products .
NG@@ O@@ s ( water supply and waste water collection and hand@@ ling ) have been suffici@@ ently developed and ob@@ s@@ olete , its capacity is not econom@@ ically justified , the technologies used are ener@@ g@@ y-@@ inten@@ sive and not all environmental requirements .
this will rest@@ ri@@ ct the development of the activity in particular in remo@@ te areas .
access to water infrastructure has a very significant impact on the development of u@@ ti@@ lity services , social ca@@ tering , health and tour@@ ism indus@@ tries .
L@@ at@@ via must determine the time@@ -@@ limit for trans@@ position of internal market rules , but also ensure coordination between the national administration and political level of the trans@@ position direc@@ tives .
as at 7 September 2005 L@@ at@@ via had not notified the trans@@ position of the EU Direc@@ tives ( or 0.@@ 5 % of the total number of direc@@ tives ) .
given that 9@@ 9.@@ 5 % of the Direc@@ tives were trans@@ posed in L@@ at@@ via ’ s nor@@ ma@@ tive position of 7 September 2005 , it fully confir@@ ms that the Lisbon go@@ al was met by at least 9@@ 8@@ ,@@ 5 % of the trans@@ position of direc@@ tives or the per@@ mis@@ sible number of direc@@ tives .
the trans@@ position and implementation of the internal market direc@@ tives will dep@@ end directly on the establishment of a common monitoring system for the trans@@ position of EU legislation .
there is no effective comprehensive da@@ tab@@ ase to monitor the trans@@ position of EU legislation at present , which would provide the opportunity to monitor the trans@@ position process within a number of reference points , and therefore , in addition to other circumstances , the trans@@ position process of the Direc@@ tives s@@ low@@ s down .
the national administra@@ tions of public administra@@ tions reduce their capacity to ensure the qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tive and ti@@ mely compliance of EU direc@@ tives with the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an legal system .
the restrictions on fre@@ ed@@ oms of the internal market in E@@ li were in most of the lost before the accession of L@@ at@@ via to the EU , but there are ob@@ sta@@ cles to existing transactions .
significant ob@@ sta@@ cles ar@@ ise from existing operating licences and time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing administrative operations requ@@ ir@@ ing businesses to receive additional money and time and have the wor@@ st impact on SMEs .
therefore , it is necessary to analy@@ se the val@@ idity and compliance of existing different licen@@ sing and other restrictions with EU requirements , including professi@@ ons , no@@ tari@@ es , accoun@@ tan@@ ts , ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ cts , eng@@ ine@@ ers , eng@@ ine@@ ers and pharma@@ ceu@@ tic@@ als .
in order to introduce uni@@ form and harmonised competition policy , L@@ at@@ via ’ s competition standards were harmonised in 2004 according to the requirements of EU competition standards .
in order to prevent barri@@ ers to competition cross@@ ing borders or preven@@ ting potential dis@@ tor@@ tions of competition , the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an Com@@ peti@@ tion Authority started - active cooperation with the European Commission and the competition authorities of the Member States .
the electricity market gradu@@ ally op@@ ens .
as at 1 July 2004 , the status of quali@@ fied free cus@@ tom@@ ers in the case of legal persons was set at 0,@@ 0 G@@ W@@ h .
therefore , only ho@@ use@@ hol@@ ds cannot choo@@ se to choo@@ se the suppli@@ er and the opening of the electricity market will be guaran@@ teed up to 75 % .
until now , none of the electricity suppli@@ ers have changed .
in order to stimu@@ late competition and encourage the entry of alternative suppli@@ ers , electricity transfer and distribution fun@@ ctions are leg@@ ally and fun@@ ction@@ ally separ@@ ated from fun@@ ctions of electricity production and sel@@ ling .
the conditions for electricity supply struc@@ tures are defined in the electricity market law .
E@@ l buil@@ ds our common future and takes global commitments using only 1 % of its streng@@ th .
in the focus of the C@@ ul@@ tural Dec@@ isions , today , it is a challenge for our society to respon@@ d to the challenges of our society in the interests of better life .
the European Parliament is the only one directly ele@@ cted by the EU .
this part of our website will find information on how Parliament will organ@@ ise its work through different committees , which is important for the European Parliament &apos;s work on the basis of the decisions of the European Parliament and the Council of Minis@@ ters in many policy areas .
Parliament has an active role in dra@@ wing up legislation on the daily lives of its citizens , such as environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods , and the free movement of the EU &apos;s annual budget .
the European Parliament consis@@ ts of 7@@ 36 members ele@@ cted from 27 Member States of the enlar@@ ged European Union .
since 19@@ 79 MEPs have ele@@ cted direct and univer@@ sal elections for five years .
each Member State deci@@ des which elections will be organised , but they must comply with the same democratic basic rules : gender equality and secret voting .
in all Member States , an ele@@ ction age is 18 years , except in Austria , where it is 16 years .
the European elections are already gover@@ ned by a number of common principles : direct and general elections , proportion@@ ate represen@@ tation and a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year renewable term of office .
as a general rule , the propor@@ tion of the population of each Member State is distribu@@ ted in propor@@ tion to the propor@@ tion .
each Member State has a fir@@ m number of places – most of the 99 and least 5 .
equality between men and women : the role of women in the European Parliament is stron@@ ger .
currently , a third of MEPs are women .
members of the EP share their time between Brussels , S@@ tras@@ bour@@ g and their dis@@ tri@@ ct , in Brussels , atten@@ ding meetings of committees and political groups in Brussels and on additional par@@ t-@@ ses@@ sions in the plenary session .
in par@@ alle@@ l , they must , of course , de@@ vote time to their dis@@ tri@@ ct .
members of the European Parliament shall be gro@@ up@@ ed into common political views rather than nation@@ ality .
they shall use their mandate independ@@ ently .
since the power of Members of the European Parliament is increasing , they will affect all their activities in the every@@ day life of citizens : environment , consumer protection , transport and education , culture , health , etc .
the new Sta@@ tute of Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 , in the new Sta@@ tute , the working conditions of the EP member have been rev@@ ised more transparent and im@@ pos@@ ing a uni@@ form EU budget for all members .
in the European Parliament , all Community languages are equ@@ ally important : all documents of Parliament will be published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and every member of the European Union is entitled to speak in their official language .
what would be better to ensure the transparency of Parliament &apos;s work and acc@@ essi@@ bility throughout the public ?
multi@@ l@@ ingu@@ al@@ ism in European agreements clearly refle@@ cts the cultural and l@@ ingu@@ is@@ tic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes the European institutions more acc@@ es@@ sible and transparent to ensure the success of the democratic system of the EU .
the European Parliament dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es between the EU institutions from other EU institutions to ensure multi@@ l@@ ingu@@ al@@ ism .
all EU citizens must have the opportunity to acqu@@ ain@@ t them with legislation directly concerning them in their own language .
and since every European citiz@@ en has the right to stand in elections to the European Parliament , it is un@@ reasonable to ask members of the perfect pre@@ servation of a single language .
the right of each member to read Parliament &apos;s documents in its language , discus@@ sions and the word shall be ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly set out in Parliament &apos;s rules of procedure .
in addition , the European Parliament , as legis@@ la@@ tor , must ensure the good l@@ ingu@@ is@@ tic quality of all accep@@ table acts in all official languages .
furthermore , the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citiz@@ en to monitor Parliament &apos;s work , ask questions and to ob@@ tain ans@@ w@@ ers in their language .
the European Parliament , in its resolution of 9 October , sugges@@ ts that &amp; quot ; past European elections and refer@@ endu@@ ms demonstra@@ te that they are more likely to take part in people who are aware of issues related to the EU , and less informed citizens are less likely &amp; quot ; .
in October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration on &amp; quot ; Communic@@ ating Europe in Communic@@ ating Europe &amp; quot ; , in order to under@@ line the political read@@ iness of all EU institutions and Member States at all levels of EU institutions and Member States .
the main objective of the Joint Dec@@ lar@@ ation is to provide citizens with fair and di@@ verse information on the EU in order to enable them to play an active role in the public debate on EU issues .
the Joint Dec@@ lar@@ ation was adopted by the EU institutions to res@@ ol@@ ve problems with the EU in cooperation with the Member States in order to ensure communication at the high@@ est level at the high@@ est possible level .
in this context they expressed their desi@@ re to develop sy@@ ner@@ gies with national , regional and local authorities and civil society representatives .
although each Member State and each institution have its own communication strategy and its priorities , Parliament , the Council and the Commission agreed to establish a small number of common communication priorities for each year .
in addition , the Commission is invi@@ ted to give fe@@ ed@@ back to other EU institutions at the beginning of each year in the implementation of the most important achie@@ vements of the previous year &apos;s communication priorities .
the European Union was created to end the frequ@@ ent bloo@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ war war , which was the second World W@@ ar .

the economy is good times , par@@ tly because the EU countries will stop colle@@ cting customs duties .
in addition , they will establish joint control over food production , resulting in sufficient food and shor@@ tly ar@@ ising from agricultural products .
in May 19@@ 68 , the fa@@ m@@ ous stu@@ dent pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful rest@@ ri@@ ction in Par@@ is and &amp; quot ; 6@@ 8@@ -@@ gener@@ ation &amp; quot ; will start to link many changes in society and human beha@@ vi@@ our .
on 1 January 19@@ 73 , the number of members of the European Union will gro@@ w to n@@ ine , if the accession of Ireland , Den@@ mark and the United Kingdom .
a short but viol@@ ent Ara@@ bi@@ a-@@ Is@@ ra@@ eli war in October 19@@ 73 br@@ ings energy crisis and economic problems .
f@@ alling in Europe &apos;s last ri@@ ght@@ -@@ hand dic@@ ta@@ tor@@ ships , when the Por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese regime is dro@@ pped in Portugal , and in 19@@ 75 , General Fran@@ co will die in Spain .
in the context of regional policy , it is set up to allo@@ cate su@@ ms to create jobs and develop infrastructure in po@@ ore@@ r regions .
the influ@@ ence of the European Parliament in the EU is increasing and the citizens will be able to choo@@ se directly from Parliament in 19@@ 79 .
in Europe and world , the Pol@@ ish trade uni@@ on will rise to S@@ oli@@ dar@@ no@@ ś@@ ć and its lea@@ der , L@@ ech Wal@@ es@@ a , when the shi@@ p@@ building stri@@ kes of 19@@ 80 in the sum@@ mer of 19@@ 80 .
in 19@@ 81 the EU will become Greece and five years later , Spain and Portugal will jo@@ in the S@@ pan@@ ish and Portugal .
in 19@@ 87 the Single European Act will be signed .
this agreement pu@@ ts the foun@@ dation for a comprehensive si@@ x@@ -@@ year programme aimed at tack@@ ling the EU &apos;s cross-border free trade problems and thus develop a common market .
the political brea@@ k@@ down will lead to the re@@ opening of the Ber@@ lin W@@ all on 9 November 19@@ 89 and re@@ opening the border between E@@ as@@ tern and W@@ es@@ tern Germany after a period of 28 years .
the col@@ lapse of Commun@@ ism across Central and E@@ as@@ tern Europe will strengthen the neigh@@ bour@@ hood of Europe@@ ans .
in 199@@ 3 , the creation of a common market is completed by the free movement of goods , services , people and money .
in the 199@@ 0@@ s , two new agreements will also be concluded : 199@@ 3 the Treaty on European Union , or M@@ aas@@ tri@@ ch@@ t Treaty and the Treaty of A@@ m@@ s@@ ter@@ dam in 1999 .
citizens are increas@@ ingly concerned about prote@@ cting the environment , while looking for new opportunities for European security and defence .
in 199@@ 5 the EU will receive three new members , Austria , Fin@@ land and Swe@@ den .
the Schen@@ gen Ag@@ reements with the small town of Luxembourg have become a gradu@@ al opportunity to travel to the people without state borders .
mil@@ li@@ ons of young people go to the EU with support in other countries .
communication will become e@@ asi@@ er and increas@@ ingly people can use mo@@ bile phone and inter@@ net .
the new currency of many Europe@@ ans can become the euro .
the political ga@@ p between the E@@ as@@ tern and W@@ es@@ tern Europe will be decla@@ red finally exce@@ e@@ ded in 2004 , with no more than 10 new countries .
many people think that Europe now has time for its constitu@@ tion , but it is far from easy to agree on what it should be and the debate on the future of Europe .
the euro allow@@ s for directly prices to be compared in all Member States using this .
trans@@ national travel is e@@ asi@@ er , since there is no longer a cost of cash .
competition in the common market has hel@@ ped to increase quality and lower prices .
phone calls , Internet connection and f@@ light tri@@ ps .
E@@ l prote@@ cts consumers from in@@ juri@@ es and quality products regar@@ d@@ less of whether goods are pur@@ cha@@ sed from home or other country .
E@@ l also sets the high@@ est food safety standards .
E@@ l citizens can live , work or re@@ ti@@ re in other EU countries .
temporary restrictions on the free movement of the 12 new Member States are gradu@@ ally elimin@@ ated .
over two million young people have been stu@@ d@@ ying or training in the EU programmes in another European country .
thanks to this , every stu@@ dent and other stu@@ dent , which is E@@ ras@@ mus , Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do and the other cross-border partnership programmes will know .
E@@ l will not decide what school is lear@@ ned , but trying to ensure that the acqu@@ ired education and professional quali@@ fications are recognised without problems in other EU countries .
the good health of the environment is an important issue for the governments of Europe@@ ans and their countries .
the EU is therefore at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of prote@@ cting and comb@@ ating climate change in the global environment .
since pollu@@ tion does not recogn@@ ise borders , EU countries have already ac@@ ted for years .
it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing that the European ri@@ vers and be@@ aches are cle@@ an@@ er , car@@ s pollu@@ ting less , and stri@@ ct rules for waste management .
Europe &apos;s dangerous waste can no longer be transpor@@ ted to poor countries .
it also applies stri@@ ct EU rules to ensure the safety of the chemi@@ c@@ als used by businesses and the environment .
the aim of the E@@ l is to make transport , industry , agriculture and tour@@ ism work so that they do not destro@@ y natural resources - in other words that development is sustainable .
to stop climate change , EU le@@ ad@@ ers have agreed stri@@ ct measures to reduce gre@@ en@@ house ga@@ ses by 20 % by 2020 .
energy is the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of the long-term climate policy of the EU and the EU has set binding targets for the introduction of win@@ d , hydro@@ - and so@@ lar energy and other clean renewable energy sources .
in addition to comb@@ ating climate change , it hel@@ ps to promote the economy and ensure a more sta@@ ble energy supply by reducing European depend@@ ence on foreign oil and gas imports .
E@@ l has already introduced an innovative allow@@ ance trading scheme , which is the use of ener@@ g@@ y-@@ consum@@ ing companies benef@@ iting from energy consumption and the en@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s are pun@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by en@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
the euro ( € ) is probably one of the most tan@@ gi@@ ble achie@@ vements of the EU .
the common currency is 16 countries in use in 16 countries living over two thir@@ ds of the EU population .
other countries will jo@@ in , if their economy is ready .
all Euro@@ s and euro co@@ ins can be used in all countries where the euro is in place .
pa@@ per@@ work is id@@ en@@ tical every@@ where , but there is a common design on the other side and the identification mark of the country of origin .
the euro is in the following countries : Austria , Belgium , Spain , the Netherlands , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Cy@@ pr@@ us , Luxembourg , Malta , Portugal , France , Sloven@@ ia , Fin@@ land and the United Kingdom .
our society is fa@@ ire@@ r and more effective than we dis@@ crimin@@ ate against other people , gender , dis@@ ability , ra@@ ce or other specific fea@@ tures .
the EU is therefore pro@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing discrimination .
in the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , the first EU agreements contained a clear rule , men and women must receive equal pay for equal work .
with this , the EU was in the fight against women &apos;s rights and today form an integra@@ l part of EU policies .
in order to fight cross-border crime and terrorism , the EU countries have taken steps to ensure full cooperation between police and customs officials , the migration agencies and the cour@@ ts .
one practical measure is the European Ar@@ rest W@@ ar@@ r@@ ant , which facili@@ ta@@ tes the transfer of sus@@ pe@@ cted persons from the country where they are ar@@ res@@ ted , the country where their actions are to be investi@@ gated and jud@@ ged .
the E@@ l countries also coordin@@ ate asylum policy and strengthen control at the EU &apos;s external borders .
since EU citizens are entitled to live in all Member States , their rights must be protected in all EU countries .
the governments of the Member States must ensure the uni@@ form application of EU legislation and the enfor@@ ce@@ ability of each national court rul@@ ing in other Member States .
E@@ l has made a lot of simpli@@ fication of cross-border justice , such as mar@@ ri@@ age , brea@@ ku@@ p , di@@ vor@@ ce and child care issues and other civil dispu@@ tes .
new skills need and all we have to do is de@@ vote more time to learning .

the war between EU countries is in@@ con@@ ce@@ i@@ va@@ ble today , thanks to un@@ ity between countries over the past 50 years .
in view of this success , the EU now aims at promoting peace and stability outside its borders .
the first and best way to avoid confli@@ cts is to increase pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity throughout the world .
E@@ l as the world &apos;s big@@ gest trade force is using its influ@@ ence to establish fair rules in global trade .
E@@ l is trying to ensure that glob@@ alisation will also benefit the po@@ ore@@ r countries .
today , the EU will give more humanita@@ rian aid and development aid as someone else .
E@@ l s@@ ends military and police missions into trou@@ b@@ led areas , such as Bal@@ kan@@ s .
this is a defence part of the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
the European Union is an example of how the economic and political resources of the democratic countries in the common interest are success@@ fully conne@@ cted to the other regions of the world .

from 50 years ago , when six foun@@ ding members come together , the European Union has con@@ st@@ antly attra@@ cted new fre@@ sh@@ men and this process cul@@ min@@ ated in 2004 and 2007 when 15 me@@ mber@@ ship of the 4@@ 0@@ th enlar@@ gement was combin@@ ed with 45 .

he wasn &apos;t the only son of his father , even though he was the ol@@ dest , his brother Wil@@ lia@@ m was in his own business as a C@@ u@@ c@@ ko@@ ld P@@ il@@ li , and he had three sis@@ ters in the A@@ v@@ on St@@ . Phi@@ li@@ p .
M@@ organ@@ ite &apos;s nes@@ ts were found in a number of places in the city , but the M@@ organ@@ s of the R@@ ed C@@ lan - who were in the mid@@ dle of a long time ago - have been living in Wal@@ es to make sure that there was a ne@@ p@@ he@@ w , and they had a chance to get ca@@ ught .
Ric@@ har@@ di &apos;s father wasn &apos;t one of them , but he didn &apos;t have reason to dis@@ gra@@ ce .
after a short school in primary school , he went to work as a me@@ al , and later , a free man , a free man who paid his fin@@ es to the state of the hol@@ der .
he was also organised in a soci@@ ally appropriate mar@@ ri@@ age ; Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t B@@ ig@@ gs had come from B@@ ed@@ min@@ s@@ ter &apos;s ne@@ are@@ st we@@ alth far@@ m , and in@@ ter alia , in@@ ter alia , the reading of reading skills , although he did not understand .
children , the first of these girls , came from a sufficient frequ@@ ency , so that some of them are un@@ be@@ ar@@ able pain and gri@@ ef .
when D@@ ick lear@@ ned to rule him@@ self so much to pull out the e@@ j@@ ac@@ u@@ lation , the children survi@@ ved the two living son and three girls .
a family , and enough small enough to take care of more .
di@@ ck wanted at least one son to lear@@ n how to read and w@@ rite , and his hop@@ es were fo@@ cus@@ ing on Richard when it was clear that two years youn@@ ger Wil@@ lia@@ m was not a te@@ ac@@ her .
so , when Richard was seven years old , he was s@@ mas@@ hed into Col@@ st@@ on Po@@ is@@ s@@ las@@ h Sch@@ ool and had a fa@@ m@@ ous blu@@ e co@@ at that decla@@ red his father to be poor but hon@@ or@@ able , an@@ gel@@ s .
and in the next five years , he was filled with li@@ tera@@ cy and compu@@ ter skills .
he lear@@ ned to w@@ rite a hand@@ some hand , to calcu@@ late , s@@ w@@ allow him@@ self through Ca@@ es@@ ar G@@ alli@@ a W@@ ars , C@@ ic@@ er@@ o &apos;s calls and O@@ vi@@ di@@ us Me@@ ta@@ mor@@ p@@ ho@@ ses , and the s@@ cho@@ ol@@ mas@@ ter of the s@@ cho@@ ols .
since he was a good stu@@ dent , even though the dist@@ inc@@ tn@@ ess of dist@@ ress , and a poli@@ te ar@@ ts , he es@@ cap@@ ed from the char@@ ity of mis@@ sing mis@@ ter Col@@ st@@ on , and more than many others .
during the tw@@ el@@ ve years , it was time to leave school and to find a business or call for a job .
however , in a large sur@@ prise of rela@@ tives , he did not choo@@ se any of the M@@ organ@@ s &apos; existing activities .
his big@@ gest for@@ gi@@ veness pro@@ ved to be mechan@@ ics , the pi@@ ec@@ es of things , and it was a wonder@@ ful pati@@ ence for young man .
and in his choice , the app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p be@@ came the mas@@ ter To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s at the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s who held a weap@@ on of weap@@ ons .
D@@ ad@@ dy f@@ elt a qu@@ i@@ et jo@@ y , he had a ple@@ asure that one of Mor@@ gan is growing up for a hand@@ craft .
be@@ sides , the war was part of life and the war needed gun@@ s .
the man who re@@ pa@@ irs weap@@ ons and re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing , threa@@ ten@@ ed no thre@@ at to the bat@@ tle@@ field .
for Ric@@ har@@ d , seven years old app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps were jo@@ y@@ ful for working and learning , although a little mo@@ dest for physical ple@@ asu@@ res .
like the other app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , he worked , he li@@ ved at the ho@@ st &apos;s house , ser@@ ved him at the din@@ er , filled her in the st@@ oma@@ ch , and s@@ lep@@ t on the flo@@ or .
fortu@@ na@@ tely , L@@ ord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was a good mas@@ ter and even better a weap@@ on .
although he was able to prepar@@ e beautiful du@@ el@@ li@@ p@@ ole@@ s and hun@@ ting gun@@ s , he had enough to understand that in the areas of success , Man@@ ton had to be in Man@@ ton but Man@@ ton was not able to be outside Lon@@ don .
this is how it was for the work of the war cha@@ mpi@@ ons , among the sol@@ di@@ ers , to be called &quot; P@@ ru@@ n B@@ ess &quot; .
at the age of 19 , Richard received a mas@@ ter certificate and mo@@ ved out of H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s &apos;s ho@@ use@@ hold , but not his work@@ sho@@ p .
he continued to work on the P@@ ru@@ n B@@ es@@ side .
and he married , as a nur@@ se of the app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p .
the spo@@ use be@@ came her mother &apos;s brother &apos;s daughter , a mus@@ cle co@@ us@@ in , but that the English ch@@ ur@@ ch had no objec@@ tion to the ch@@ ur@@ ch of his gir@@ l@@ friend in St@@ . Ja@@ mes@@ James , she was in front of his ch@@ ur@@ ch .
mar@@ ri@@ age was arran@@ ged , but there was a love in love with the spo@@ uses in the years .
although there was some conf@@ usion about the son of Richard Mor@@ gan and Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t Bri@@ g@@ gs Bri@@ g@@ gs , Richard Mor@@ gan , who took Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t Bri@@ g@@ gs .
until the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s Ar@@ med Cha@@ mber fully worked , there was nothing we@@ ir@@ d because the young couple li@@ ved in the A@@ v@@ on S@@ tre@@ et A@@ v@@ on S@@ tre@@ et at A@@ v@@ on S@@ tre@@ et .
mar@@ ri@@ age was a@@ warded in 17@@ 67 , three years after the end of the 7@@ -@@ year war with France , in spite of the un@@ popu@@ lar re@@ venu@@ es , in spite of the increase in the re@@ venu@@ es of Eng@@ land , and the s@@ w@@ allow@@ ing ar@@ my and the fle@@ et sh@@ ar@@ p .
the weap@@ ons are no longer needed , so the cha@@ mpi@@ ons and the stu@@ dents at one time from H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , until the entire company was com@@ posed of Richard and L@@ ord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s .
and then , for a while after a little M@@ ary was born in 17@@ 70 in 19@@ 70 , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ ant to let Ric@@ har@@ d go .
&quot; come to work , &quot; called D@@ ick Mor@@ gan .
&quot; they are coming and go , but the ru@@ m remains . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened .
Ric@@ har@@ di &apos;s mother was always called bri@@ ef@@ ly in Ma@@ g and Richard &apos;s wife , Pe@@ g , both deri@@ ved from Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t .
however , the problem was that all the men of Eng@@ land – if the de@@ sc@@ end@@ ants of ri@@ g@@ ged res@@ ol@@ ves are de@@ sc@@ end@@ ants , who b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed C@@ ran@@ fi@@ el@@ ds and O@@ ne@@ si@@ ph@@ or@@ us@@ ts , were the name of Ca@@ ther@@ ine , Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ ts , E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ eth or Mar@@ y@@ d .
it was one of the few practices that f@@ it for everyone , the K@@ ing .
&amp; quot ; This is what I see for the first time ! &amp; quot ;
it called a c@@ ali@@ p@@ o di@@ ver who was just sur@@ fac@@ ed by a research ship behind the sur@@ face , and he ba@@ rely got a word from the mouth .
after the la@@ d@@ der s@@ w@@ im@@ ming , he took the fla@@ mes and the mas@@ k down and pas@@ sed them to the fer@@ ry .
then he dis@@ tra@@ cted him@@ self from the water , lo@@ sing the balance of the bal@@ lo@@ ons for a moment , but by land@@ ing from the top of the fore@@ head , the entire shi@@ p@@ y@@ ard was alive .
in a moment , the dri@@ ll was sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by other cre@@ w members who were already waiting on the de@@ ck .
Jack Ho@@ ward ste@@ pped down the cap@@ tain and s@@ mi@@ led a friend .
he still couldn &apos;t believe that such a bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ i@@ ded guy could move so much .
in the T@@ ag@@ a@@ de@@ ck de@@ ck , he opened up his mouth , a lo@@ vely one in the years of the year .
&amp; quot ; And we thought you were s@@ w@@ im@@ ming back to A@@ th@@ ens and sit in the gin and ton@@ ic , with his father &apos;s pool water . ”
the study is not based on ro@@ ck qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tive qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tive data , fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ts or personal opinions , but has been asse@@ mb@@ led from many sources , including inter@@ views , over@@ views , tr@@ ends and hearing assess@@ ments .
all data before 199@@ 0 based on inter@@ views and nu@@ mer@@ ous ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers , te@@ lev@@ ision , and radi@@ o sear@@ ches are based on the search for information collection methods used in the past .
schedu@@ les for the period after 1998 are based on everything that has occur@@ red over the last 11 years and I have read about 1000 different studies .
the schedu@@ le of 2009 and the following years is based on the pre@@ di@@ ctions of me and other people for the coming years .
the schedu@@ les are not pre@@ ten@@ ding to be a hun@@ d@@ red per@@ cent acc@@ ura@@ cy , their aim is to give an over@@ view of the situation and out@@ line social media news , targe@@ ted communication and other future .
the purpose of the article is to make people think .
we are now see@@ ing a completely no@@ vel way of how people can communic@@ ate - that makes tradi@@ tional ways of simple ways .
this is a fundamental change that makes the world what we feel , fully .
the best thing about this is that you can contribute to getting it .
come with me to the last 2@@ 10 years in the last 2@@ 10 years , in addition to the next ten years .
before we find out the future , we &apos;ll see how we arri@@ ved today .
in the 18@@ 00@@ s , people had to go out and meet them .
everything was in contact with the fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face .
if you were to sell the product , you should have gone to the local market and the only opportunity to communic@@ ate in the general plan was to meet a personal or p@@ ho@@ to table .
this me@@ ant for you to be in the right place to get information or to give it in the right place .
you didn &apos;t know what was going on in another town , and couldn &apos;t sell their products to people in another place .
they were talking about some no@@ vel concep@@ t called ne@@ w@@ s@@ paper ...
by 19@@ 00 , ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers and maga@@ z@@ ines have changed communication , allow@@ ing us to get news from places where we never had .
we got our ide@@ as to the people we never saw , and sell their products to others who were far away .
we had to go out and talk to other people , but we got to be famili@@ ar with our city .
it was inc@@ redi@@ ble ... the first real information re@@ volu@@ tion .
the world started to open everyone .
since 19@@ 20 , a new source of information on people &apos;s attention - radi@@ o .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , the second person &apos;s voice was heard from hun@@ dre@@ ds of mi@@ les away .
but most import@@ antly , the latest information was possible in real time .
it was the next en@@ or@@ m@@ ous development in history .
however , the radi@@ o development time me@@ ant that , in 19@@ 60 , the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers were domin@@ ated by our lives .
if you wanted to get the latest news or introduce people to their product , you would have used the ne@@ w@@ s@@ paper .
it see@@ med to be a very much longer information source .
this situation started in 19@@ 60 .
the radi@@ o reached and two main sources of information were broad@@ ly trans@@ mitted on the radi@@ o and more detailed news trans@@ mitted through the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers and maga@@ z@@ ines .
it was a great time for media , although some said that the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers would be able to compe@@ te with the radi@@ o , the argu@@ ment that we might have heard of the next 50 years .
in the next 40 years , the following tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es were introduced : te@@ lev@@ ision .
it started to colle@@ ct public interest in the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s and the early 199@@ 0@@ s , and the spread of the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers and maga@@ z@@ ines , while domin@@ ated the radi@@ o .
now , people got information to hear and watch .
the years 19@@ 70 were also time when publish@@ ers of ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers re@@ ali@@ zed something was ter@@ ri@@ bly wrong with their sales market .
they had a lot of problems to compe@@ te with radi@@ o , but te@@ lev@@ ision was again from another class .
only eight years later , and te@@ lev@@ ision led to the information world , the radi@@ o was almost just a place where a free mus@@ ic could be heard and the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers were doing everything that could per@@ sist .
the continu@@ ous development of technology continued with consisten@@ cy that was never seen before .
a new ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on in sha@@ dow : the Internet .
1998 was a year when the inter@@ net be@@ came we@@ ir@@ d from a we@@ ir@@ d place , which was un@@ ques@@ tion@@ ably important , br@@ inging the at@@ ti@@ tude to the fact that each company must have a website .
the re@@ volu@@ tion has be@@ gun three years early , but in 1998 it reached a cri@@ tical mass and at@@ temp@@ ted attention , despite the fact that it was used rela@@ tively little and most people had no access to it .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future - the beginning of the new era .
it was a place where everyone could have got information every@@ where - at least in the@@ ory .
people started to understand that the Internet was more than just information .
when you jo@@ ined the conver@@ sa@@ tion , you got something back and being part of it instead of being a monitor .
it was the most important thing that you wanted to choo@@ se and when you wanted to do it .
inter@@ net opportunities were be@@ a@@ ten .
in 2004 , only six years later , the Internet had changed the way we were in the information .
te@@ lev@@ ision and ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers were domin@@ ated by our news sources , but the ne@@ w@@ est world was defin@@ ite@@ ly on the Internet .
people made new web@@ sites and dis@@ covered the world applications .
people have been able to do so much and participate in so many areas in order to show a new reci@@ pe for information .
for the first time in my life , we were in contact with more information than we could have .
in the age of ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers we had to choo@@ se what we wanted to see .
in 2004 , we had to choo@@ se what we did not want to see .
it had a de@@ vasta@@ ting influ@@ ence on the tradi@@ tional ima@@ ge .
in the past , it was possible to get people &apos;s attention just to do something .
people wanted more choice , so it was just a new option .
in 2004 this change , since there was no difference in doing something , it was supposed to be better .
2004 was also a year when another ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on be@@ gan : net@@ working networks .
the reci@@ pe was qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly colle@@ cted through the blo@@ g@@ gers .
it was easy for everyone , simple and acc@@ es@@ sible to sh@@ aring their ide@@ as .
for the first time , everyone had a chance to create their own information , without anything technical .
hand@@ ling information be@@ came a professional too@@ l for all tools .
three years later , the social element of the Internet sho@@ wed how pow@@ er@@ ful the voice of people actually is .
for the first time , te@@ lev@@ ision was no longer a source of information and ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers f@@ ought for survi@@ val .
everyone wanted to create their little world and conne@@ ct it to his friends .
2007 was also a fra@@ cture point for tradi@@ tional web@@ sites which people compar@@ ed with ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers , sta@@ tic and pas@@ sive content .
we wanted an active information .
we wanted to be part of this , not just looking at it .
blo@@ gs started getting into trouble .
as the te@@ lev@@ ision has elimin@@ ated the radi@@ o ( as it was better and the ri@@ cher way to give people the information ) , social networks elimin@@ ated blo@@ g@@ gers .
social profi@@ le is more active for people to share it with what they care about .
social networks are simp@@ ly better for this , and the blo@@ gs are un@@ able to stay behind .
two years later , today , the new Internet is the whole of our world .
the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers are dead in the water and people look less te@@ lev@@ ision than ever .
we are new k@@ ings , using the tools of social networks to contact and communic@@ ate .
even the tradi@@ tional we@@ b site dies , which has killed the un@@ ru@@ th@@ less for@@ ces of the continu@@ ous f@@ low of information from social networks .
over the last 2@@ 10 years we &apos;ve seen an ama@@ zing development how we can get information .
the main steps are :
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 deci@@ ding when to look at something and to watch .
5 .
6 .
7 .
2009 is the beginning of the next re@@ volu@@ tion .
all we know is starting to change .
the first and most dra@@ matic change is the social news con@@ vention .
it will take over quickly our need to know what is happ@@ ening in the world .
the news will no longer be trans@@ mitted by jour@@ nal@@ is@@ ts , since it is now coming from everyone .
they will be trans@@ mitted directly from the source , leaving tradi@@ tional media .
instead of the jour@@ nal@@ ist trans@@ mit@@ ting what analy@@ s@@ ts say , you hear it from the analy@@ st .
social news will get news from the source and cen@@ sor@@ ship .
there is a new enter@@ tain@@ ment wa@@ ve ( blu@@ e blu@@ e and pur@@ ple areas ) which domin@@ ate ga@@ mes , vide@@ o and sound flow@@ s .
instead of playing a T@@ V chan@@ nel , you decide what you want to watch and watch it .
we no longer jo@@ in the chan@@ nel@@ s where someone else deci@@ des what we can look at .
you &apos;re che@@ cking the whole experience .
in the form of a targe@@ ted information , a new concep@@ t will emer@@ ge .
we already see the growing number of mo@@ bile te@@ lep@@ hon@@ y services which provide local information about this area where you are lo@@ cated .
for example , instead of sho@@ wing all the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants in the world , the phone will only show the list in your area .
it &apos;s something that gro@@ ws in the next few years .
in the world where we have access to more information than we can consu@@ me , it is very important to ob@@ tain a very important element , exten@@ ding much further from the simple position of location that we see today .
the world of the next five or ten years is chan@@ ging .
all tradi@@ tional forms will even@@ tually die .
prin@@ ted ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers no longer exist , te@@ lev@@ ision is replaced by the current chan@@ nel@@ s , which you will be able to look at when you want .
radi@@ o broad@@ cas@@ ts are intended to re@@ place f@@ las@@ h@@ -@@ cas@@ ting and vide@@ o broad@@ cas@@ ts .
the web@@ sites have much s@@ mal@@ ler role - their primary function is to be the brea@@ k@@ down of activities that can be done el@@ se@@ where , be@@ coming a place where people can use raw materials in other places .
many web@@ sites and communication networks jo@@ in one .
social news , as described previ@@ ously , will be the way in which people are communic@@ ating .
the tradi@@ tional jour@@ nal@@ ism is enti@@ rely en@@ coun@@ tering , as people get information directly from the source .
everyone is a potential repor@@ ter , but new advan@@ tag@@ es for the use of target groups elimin@@ ate most of the pois@@ on .
jour@@ nal@@ is@@ ts will become an ed@@ it@@ or who instead of trans@@ mit@@ ting news , br@@ ings them together , giving us more pic@@ ture .
the future f@@ low of the future is person@@ ally person@@ alised , and it is con@@ st@@ antly chan@@ ging according to what you are looking at , much in the same way that L@@ ast@@ .@@ f@@ m is doing mus@@ ic today .
it shall contain a target group in any form .
you have control of every single inf@@ o that &apos;s moving towards you .
in 2010 , two new concep@@ ts will emer@@ ge .
one of them is inte@@ lli@@ gent information where the information flow@@ s can invol@@ ve parts of several different sources of news , not just simp@@ ly pul@@ ling data , but by taking it together , sh@@ aring it into parts and giving valu@@ able parts .
instead of the five different artic@@ les written on the same subject , you will be given one , high@@ light the important interest points .
how secure is your Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts ?
EU tests show serious risks to the electri@@ c impact of la@@ mps and fire .
stay safe - turn them off when you go to bed or out of the house .
the market in the market surve@@ y carried out by the Commission sugges@@ ted that each third test of Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts had a direct fire safety or electri@@ c impact risk .
the tests were carried out in Germany , Hung@@ ary , the Netherlands , Sloven@@ ia , Sloven@@ ia and Slova@@ kia of all categories of price categories .
the samp@@ les were che@@ cked over 20 requirements and many f@@ ell through more than one test .
the Commission found f@@ ilm@@ -@@ w@@ ir@@ ing , we@@ ak le@@ ad@@ ership and poor is@@ o@@ lation in many la@@ mps .
only over 40 % of the samp@@ les were made in China .
in Hung@@ ary , almost 96 % of la@@ mps are dangerous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % of EU security standards did not respon@@ d .
although only five countries took part in the study , it is likely that the same la@@ mps are s@@ old throughout the EU .
the Commissioner for Con@@ su@@ mer Protection Mag@@ len@@ a K@@ une@@ va said that the results were a@@ wa@@ ke .
he ur@@ ged the EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that industry ( producers , re@@ ta@@ i@@ lers , distribu@@ tors and impor@@ ters ) should also make control more effective .
in the case of cus@@ tom@@ ers , he high@@ ligh@@ ted vig@@ il@@ ance by off@@ ering the following advice : 1 purch@@ ase of Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts from the re@@ pu@@ tation of the re@@ pu@@ tation of the re@@ pu@@ tation , never leave the li@@ ghts on and return them to the store .
it is expected that the event in S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m will take part in approximately 4 000 partici@@ pants from 1 5@@ 00@@ -@@ organis@@ m where EU efforts to make development more effective .
the general the@@ me &amp; quot ; citizens and development &amp; quot ; will focus on the effects of global w@@ arm@@ ing and po@@ ore@@ r economic down@@ turn .
although they are usually the last ones to bla@@ me , especially those countries , the economic down@@ turn and climate change are particularly affected .
the increase in the level of sea sur@@ face , de@@ serti@@ fication and increased and increased natural dis@@ as@@ ters can lead to mil@@ li@@ ons of poverty and un@@ do the Mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um Development Go@@ als .
and the current economic climate has led to a dec@@ rease in don@@ ations for developing countries , reducing food guarantees by already vulner@@ able areas .
br@@ inging together poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans , public officials , NG@@ O@@ s , business le@@ ad@@ ers , ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ cs , ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ cs , sci@@ en@@ tis@@ ts and new partners to create relations , sh@@ aring experience and development of new partners .
a period of three days , which begin@@ s on 22 October , includes training , discussion for@@ u@@ ms and work@@ sh@@ op@@ s .
&amp; quot ; Development vil@@ la@@ ge &amp; quot ; off@@ ers organisations the opportunity to present themselves to dele@@ ga@@ tes and to the public and raise awareness of their objectives .
a series of pri@@ z@@ es related to development , including the L@@ or@@ en@@ z@@ o Na@@ ta@@ li press pre@@ mi@@ um for human rights , democracy and development issues are distribu@@ ted .
the y@@ outh development pre@@ mi@@ um goes to teen@@ ag@@ ers or vide@@ o@@ tap@@ es that show human development in Africa .
on October , the EU also dis@@ clo@@ ses the first European development report .
this re@@ presents a dis@@ p@@ atch discussion on the EU approach to the Sa@@ har@@ an A@@ fri@@ can countries in the Sa@@ har@@ an Africa .
E@@ l will give more than half the development aid .
the con@@ ference of the don@@ ors s@@ ends strong sig@@ n@@ als to support Geor@@ gia .
until later , Geor@@ gia was the f@@ as@@ test e@@ vol@@ ving economy in Geor@@ gia , 12 % in 2007 .
this change in the short , but inten@@ se conflict with Russia in August .
key transport lines and u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties were dama@@ ged , buil@@ dings and ho@@ uses be@@ came a st@@ one cli@@ p and b@@ om@@ b@@ s destro@@ yed large fo@@ rest areas .
more than two months later , many foreign inves@@ tors have left , tour@@ is@@ ts are lost , un@@ employment has ris@@ en and many g@@ or@@ gi@@ ans have emp@@ ti@@ ed their bank accounts .
the World Bank is now fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ting that Geor@@ gia , the G@@ ate of energy sources Europe needs € 2.@@ 4 billion for recovery .
over the next three years , the EU has allocated EUR 500 million and the US has allowed EUR 7@@ 57 million ( 1 billion dollar@@ s ) , over half of this year .
E@@ l and the World Bank ho@@ st the don@@ ors &apos; con@@ ference on 22 October to meet the remain@@ ing 1.@@ 1 billion euro .
the event was called around 70 countries and the institution .
the aid supports re@@ construction works and hel@@ ps Geor@@ gia to satis@@ fy the first needs of these people who had to es@@ cap@@ e their ho@@ mes .
ten@@ s of tho@@ us@@ ands of people were re@@ sto@@ red , many of them will still find sh@@ el@@ ter in temporary re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
however , the long-term objective is to rest@@ ore Geor@@ gia &apos;s economy in recent years .
it is important that the crisis does not lead to the political and economic reform of Geor@@ gia , which is now more important than before the sum@@ mer of the conflict .
the former So@@ vi@@ et Republic will nor@@ m@@ ally receive around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union .
between Geor@@ gia and Russia , there are differences between S@@ outh O@@ s@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ haz@@ ia - two bro@@ ken down the prov@@ in@@ ce of Geor@@ gia , which Russia recogn@@ ises as independent countries .
two sides have the first peace tal@@ ks in G@@ ene@@ va on 15 October and tal@@ ks continue under the aus@@ pic@@ es of the UN and the European inter@@ medi@@ aries .
it enab@@ led EU obser@@ vers to move to the ce@@ ase@@ fire for these areas .

the 2008 C@@ ann@@ es f@@ esti@@ val shows the success of EU fun@@ ded fil@@ ms in the world .
f@@ our@@ teen mo@@ vi@@ es , which have parti@@ ally supported the EU media programme , have been sele@@ cted at the international fil@@ m f@@ esti@@ val of 61 .
the F@@ il@@ mi@@ f@@ esti@@ val@@ s are no longer a st@@ ran@@ ger in the EU , and there have been mil@@ li@@ ons of people over the years .
the EU media programme supports European audiovisu@@ al projects by promoting the cultural diversity of contin@@ ent through the mo@@ vi@@ e .
however , European fil@@ m mak@@ ers are fac@@ ing major challenges both inter@@ nation@@ ally and at home .
on the 19@@ th May , the si@@ x@@ th &amp; quot ; Europe Da@@ y &amp; quot ; in C@@ ann@@ es , the EU &apos;s representatives will sit together with European fil@@ m minis@@ ters and producers to discus@@ s how to stimu@@ late the audiovisu@@ al industry for greater international cooperation .
the aim is to exten@@ d the content of the content to other parts of the world and to cooper@@ ate more closely outside the EU &apos;s other fil@@ m industry .
this international partnership would contribute to the production and dis@@ se@@ mination of European fil@@ ms .
the selection of the previous year &apos;s C@@ ann@@ es f@@ esti@@ val included a single mo@@ vi@@ e financed by the EU media programme .
at the beginning of this year , several EU back@@ ground fil@@ ms ( e.g. The Coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ i@@ ters and L@@ a M@@ ô@@ me ) were presented to O@@ sc@@ ars .

E@@ l sugges@@ ts developing econom@@ ies , such as China , to rest@@ ri@@ ct CO2 emissions , in exchange for financial support from developed countries .
as regards the financial crisis , the EU and China agreed that international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic risks and the emer@@ ging and developing econom@@ ies should have more say in these institutions .

the group stresses that the assessment of the combin@@ ed fun@@ ctions carried out , and the ra@@ tional use of potential public sources has taken place in order to de@@ fine the reduction of fun@@ ctions in accordance with the results of the tasks and the assessment of fun@@ ctions aimed at reducing l@@ ine@@ ar financing .
while con@@ sent was reached on targets - a small and efficient administration , the exten@@ sion of internal and external markets to L@@ at@@ via and the promotion of employment - the members of the group and the promotion of employment for structural reforms in the future will continue to give a cle@@ are@@ r framework .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ management Group believes it is necessary to continue the active introduction of social security measures , measures contained in economic recovery plans aimed at promoting en@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship and attra@@ cting investment , to ac@@ cele@@ rate the analysis of the micro@@ economic activities and the introduction of the principle of service .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ management Group has agreed to change the need for the introduction of EU programmes , which have been late in the current period and have reached a number of two ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds with a view to the implementation of the medium-@@ si@@ zed budget , with the creation of a budget for the internal and external development of the budget .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ management Group was established in July 2009 with a view to ensuring public participation in the budget reduction and decisi@@ on-@@ making .
in the 2@@ 6@@ th and 27 November , the International Conference on Re@@ gis@@ tration Partn@@ er@@ ships took place in R@@ iga .
L@@ at@@ via and Est@@ onia jo@@ in@@ tly agree to rent a diplo@@ matic represen@@ tation of the territory in the Ara@@ b Republic of E@@ gy@@ pt .
since 1 January 2010 , L@@ at@@ via and Est@@ onia are working together with the ren@@ ted comple@@ x in the E@@ gy@@ p@@ tian Ara@@ b Republic , opti@@ mis@@ ing their administrative costs .
the agreement was reached between the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins and the Foreign Minister of Est@@ onia in the course of his official vis@@ it on 18 February , this year , and end with the following tal@@ ks between Foreign Minis@@ ters .
this initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Bal@@ tic States and the Presid@@ en@@ t-@@ in-@@ Office of the Bal@@ tic Minis@@ teri@@ al Council in the light of which L@@ at@@ via will take the form of similar projects in the future .
the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in C@@ air@@ o has ac@@ ted since 2007 , which was offici@@ ally opened in March 2009 during the vis@@ it of the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins in E@@ gy@@ pt .
since 2010 , Est@@ onia ’ s represen@@ tation will start in E@@ gy@@ pt in pre@@ mises , which are ren@@ ted together with L@@ at@@ via .
L@@ at@@ via re@@ presents Mar@@ is Sel@@ ga .
the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins called for a rap@@ id solution to the situation of fre@@ ight carri@@ ers at the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an border at the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an border .
on December , the te@@ lep@@ h@@ one conver@@ sa@@ tion took place between the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins and the Rus@@ sian Fed@@ eration Ser@@ ge@@ y La@@ v@@ ro@@ v , both parties discussed the results of the relations between the countries in 2009 , and the current developments at the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an border .
both foreign minis@@ ters sha@@ red the opinion that the situation of mutual relations this year could generally be assessed posi@@ tively .
next , Minis@@ ters re@@ vie@@ wed the agenda for the coming year in L@@ at@@ via , including further impro@@ vements in the legal framework , such as a number of important government agreements for sig@@ ning .
Minis@@ ters R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins and La@@ v@@ ro@@ v also discussed the current situation on fre@@ ight carri@@ ers at the border of L@@ at@@ via and Russia .
due to the increased customs control of the Rus@@ sian Fed@@ eration , the situation is a dra@@ matic and b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary of the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an border on the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an border , as it ca@@ uses significant loss of lo@@ s@@ ses , the foreign minister R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins said R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins .
Minis@@ ters agreed that the respective institutions of both countries , including L@@ at@@ via , L@@ at@@ via , L@@ at@@ vi@@ jas Au@@ to , should continue to work in order to nor@@ mal@@ ise the situation in the ne@@ ar future , according to the agreement reached on 18 December of the Inter@@ govern@@ mental Committee on Transport .

Madam Col@@ ing :
my name is S@@ us@@ an Har@@ ris and I w@@ rite for the stu@@ dents of Lo@@ ck@@ w@@ ood High Sch@@ ool .
we would like to invi@@ te you to participate in a special event that is happ@@ ening at our school .
you &apos;ll be hon@@ ored .
please respon@@ d by Mon@@ day , 26 February , to confir@@ m your presence .
we hope to see you here ,
sin@@ ce@@ rely , S@@ us@@ an Har@@ ris .
in 2007 , the most pow@@ er@@ ful partic@@ le ac@@ cele@@ ra@@ tor , C@@ ER@@ N &apos;s new L@@ ar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ r@@ on Col@@ li@@ der Col@@ li@@ der , measu@@ red the secre@@ ts of the energy that was only mom@@ ents after the Gre@@ at P@@ ho@@ le .
by allow@@ ing partic@@ les to b@@ oun@@ ce , when they move close to the speed of light , sci@@ en@@ tis@@ ts are hop@@ ing to find information on past forms of ma@@ inf@@ ra@@ me , using the energy separ@@ ated by col@@ lis@@ i@@ on .
what is the big investment expected for the production of the L@@ H@@ C ?
it s@@ ends two pro@@ ton spe@@ e@@ ds , partic@@ les which are formed by the at@@ om@@ ic the@@ me and bel@@ on@@ ging to the partic@@ le family , in the different direc@@ tions of the S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land , between the 27 km and the French .
to ac@@ cele@@ rate pro@@ ton and to ensure their closure of the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks , strong mag@@ ne@@ tic fields are necessary , and these fields are gener@@ ated by super@@ conduc@@ tors , materials cap@@ able of manag@@ ing electricity , and which are produced in cooperation with European industry .
the col@@ lis@@ i@@ on of pro@@ ton is at the speed of eight million times in a hu@@ ge amount of energy , 14 TE@@ V .
in order to understand the size of this number , 1 TE@@ V is about the amount of energy that uses f@@ lying sa@@ v@@ ings to move .
in the L@@ H@@ C , this energy amount will be concentra@@ ted on a million times lower than the bu@@ g .
as energy can be trans@@ ferred to partic@@ les in accordance with the restric@@ tive rela@@ tive energy equival@@ ence principle ( fa@@ m@@ ous E = m@@ c@@ 2 ) , physi@@ cs are expected to create partic@@ les which have never been seen in spe@@ e@@ ds before .
the frequ@@ ency and intensi@@ ty of col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons are important because they make the possibility of a partic@@ le appe@@ arance of partic@@ les .
there are two main nuclear spe@@ e@@ ds , which will reach the power c@@ and@@ les to 1 150 Te@@ V , but the number of min@@ or col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons per second .
for sear@@ ching for super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c ...
standard sen@@ sor@@ s are cap@@ able of analy@@ sing the impact .
the two names are C@@ MS ( Com@@ pac@@ t Mu@@ on S@@ ol@@ en@@ o@@ id ) and At@@ las ( A To@@ ro@@ ida@@ l L@@ H@@ C Ap@@ para@@ tus ) .
they focus on de@@ tection of super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c partic@@ les and H@@ ig@@ gs .
what &apos;s the super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
particula@@ te physi@@ cs include a number of sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries , such as ma@@ th and anti@@ ma@@ teri@@ al .
su@@ per sy@@ m@@ me@@ try is linked to fer@@ mi@@ on ( construction material , such as elec@@ tr@@ ons and quar@@ ters ) with each b@@ os@@ on , and vice ver@@ sa , and vice ver@@ sa .
the challenge is that the su@@ per sy@@ m@@ me@@ try of the super@@ partic@@ les ( also designa@@ ted s@@ par@@ e ) has never been seen before .
how to dis@@ cover them ?
par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , through their absence !
&quot; it &apos;s a little like being in the mo@@ vi@@ es .
you coun@@ t the number of enter@@ ing and ex@@ it people and type .
if any of the parties are mis@@ sing at the end , because you know who entered , you can guess who didn &apos;t . &apos;
in the same way , the L@@ H@@ C tests , as a result of certain clas@@ h@@ es , should emer@@ ge from these anti@@ qu@@ es that are in@@ visi@@ ble to all sen@@ sor@@ s .
know@@ ing before the col@@ lis@@ i@@ on of partic@@ le energy , they com@@ para@@ tive energy sources after col@@ lis@@ i@@ on .
if there are differences in energy in energy , some have es@@ cap@@ ed .
by calcu@@ lating the lack of energy , they know whether the super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try component or an anti@@ que component is involved .
the second challenge of the C@@ MS and L@@ H@@ S sen@@ sor@@ s is de@@ tection of H@@ ig@@ gs &apos; boss .
as regards the standard the@@ ory of the standard the@@ ory , it is expected that this should be an intera@@ ction with the partic@@ les .
how ?
let &apos;s assu@@ me there &apos;s a room for physi@@ cs stu@@ dents .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , Al@@ bert E@@ inste@@ in comes into the room , stu@@ dents ga@@ ther around him and start b@@ om@@ b@@ ing her with questions .
if Al@@ bert tries to move , he knows a soli@@ d in@@ er@@ tia because of the stu@@ dents in his side .
he &apos;s similar to those partic@@ les as the H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ ses trying to make a mu@@ tually influ@@ ential impact - they colle@@ ct mass .
also , the expected de@@ tection of these fa@@ m@@ ous b@@ os@@ on@@ ons may only be indirec@@ t : partic@@ les that ar@@ ise as a result of their de@@ gra@@ dation are those that are dis@@ covered .
K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ g@@ lu@@ oni sou@@ p
the third sen@@ s@@ or with which L@@ H@@ C is equi@@ pped is called A@@ li@@ ce ( a large i@@ on speed experi@@ ment ) .
it is intended to dete@@ ct parts of un@@ known nuclear physi@@ cs , in particular the nature of the ma@@ th , which exis@@ ted in very short time after the Gre@@ at P@@ ho@@ le and known as a quar@@ ter@@ -@@ gu@@ l@@ l@@ on plasma name .
what is this new specific@@ ity ?
in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s , sci@@ en@@ tis@@ ts re@@ ali@@ zed that pro@@ ton and neu@@ tor@@ ised , which accoun@@ ted for at@@ om@@ ic cor@@ e , were even the primary partic@@ les - quar@@ ter@@ ly .
these quar@@ ters are strong for@@ ces ( which are direc@@ ted by partic@@ les called g@@ lu@@ on@@ ons ) .
one of them is that they are di@@ verse together : they are always either in pa@@ irs or tri@@ cks ; they cannot exist alone .
the more you try to separate K@@ var@@ ki from the other quar@@ ter , the greater the streng@@ th that kee@@ ps them together , making them un@@ bun@@ d@@ led .
they say they &apos;re in pris@@ on .
however , if the pro@@ ton b@@ om@@ b@@ ing against each other is a major energy , a blo@@ ck containing quar@@ ter@@ ly and g@@ lu@@ on@@ ies will be created fre@@ ely .
then we can ref@@ er to the quar@@ ter@@ ly release of quar@@ ter@@ -@@ g@@ lu@@ on .
what kind of release ?
&amp; quot ; This is some compar@@ able s@@ ki@@ ing .
if there &apos;s not much s@@ now , the tra@@ cks can be separ@@ ated with g@@ ras@@ s@@ lands and s@@ ki@@ es are limited to their tra@@ ck .
on the other hand , if there &apos;s a lot of s@@ now , they can change the p@@ ath .
they are free of restrictions . ”
instead of s@@ now , physi@@ cs are added to the energy : the big@@ ger the quar@@ ter energy , the we@@ ak@@ er is the ti@@ er , so the high energy thre@@ sh@@ old can be separ@@ ated .
K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ g@@ lu@@ oni plasma was likely to be a matter of a micro@@ secon@@ ds after the Gre@@ at P@@ ho@@ le .
this is why physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts want to exp@@ l@@ ore the I@@ oni@@ an speed created by the L@@ H@@ C .
in nature , they are very ri@@ ch for pro@@ ton and neu@@ tr@@ ons .
they can achieve energy 1 150 TE@@ V , which is necessary for quar@@ ter@@ -@@ g@@ lu@@ ton@@ i@@ an plasma , which was un@@ prec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted in the beginning of the uni@@ verse , to create and investi@@ gate .
in@@ ma@@ tes
finally , the last sen@@ sor@@ s na@@ med L@@ H@@ C@@ b ( hu@@ ge H@@ ad@@ r@@ on ac@@ cele@@ ra@@ tor ) .
the tas@@ k is to better monitor the dis@@ par@@ ities between the ma@@ inf@@ ra@@ me and the anti@@ ma@@ teri@@ ity in order to better understand what happened to the uni@@ verse .
for each particula@@ te matter , an anti@@ que element is the same as the same mass but the counter@@ fe@@ it counter@@ fe@@ it .
therefore , there is a negative mass for electronic de@@ gre@@ es , but the anti@@ electri@@ cal power corresponding to the positive lo@@ an ( or posi@@ tion@@ ing ) .
if the electricity and the anti@@ electri@@ c power will be destro@@ yed , they will destro@@ y each other , I will result in an energy pressure .
in accordance with the standard physi@@ cs model , the amount of the uni@@ verse was set up at the beginning of the uni@@ verse and the anti@@ ma@@ teri@@ ity of anti@@ ma@@ tes .
consequ@@ ently , all partic@@ les should destro@@ y each other and the uni@@ verse should be emp@@ ty .
however , as anyone can see , there is a lot of ma@@ th .
this is the place where the question is , what is L@@ H@@ C@@ b trying to answer : where is the anti@@ ma@@ teri@@ al ?
one of the possible ans@@ w@@ ers is based on the ability of certain partic@@ les to change themselves as their anti@@ par@@ ent and vice ver@@ sa .
in this case , the existence of a ma@@ th depend@@ s on the existence of hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ( a@@ waiting pro@@ of ) that the partic@@ le conver@@ sion of partic@@ les is depend@@ ent on the op@@ posi@@ te conver@@ sion at the beginning of the uni@@ verse .
can this im@@ balance be demonstra@@ ted ?
it &apos;s actually experi@@ men@@ tally examin@@ ed with the quar@@ ter@@ -@@ type partic@@ les called the ca@@ mer@@ as .
an@@ tic@@ o@@ a@@ on@@ ics are s@@ pon@@ tane@@ ously s@@ pon@@ tane@@ ously s@@ pon@@ tane@@ ous , but there is a lot less r@@ are .
L@@ H@@ C@@ b is investi@@ g@@ ating another can@@ didate , B-@@ me@@ on@@ on , which contains an element of ele@@ mentary elements ( or an anti@@ body ) which is called a blo@@ ck of B quar@@ ter@@ ly or a beau@@ ty ( where the L@@ CH@@ b char@@ ming name must also be ) .
although partic@@ les can &apos;t be seen , they can be dete@@ cted .
for this purpose , L@@ H@@ C equi@@ pped with equipment containing a number of concentra@@ tions ( such as oni@@ on ) , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the partic@@ le speed where the impact occur@@ s .
each la@@ yer speci@@ ali@@ z@@ es a specific type of thing .
in the mid@@ dle of the sen@@ sor@@ s , there are mil@@ li@@ ons of le@@ ad@@ ers in the cha@@ mber , which gener@@ ate mil@@ li@@ ons of le@@ ad@@ ers , if part of the electri@@ c pul@@ se .
these im@@ pul@@ ses are recor@@ ded by compu@@ ters .
there &apos;s a mag@@ ne@@ tic field inside every sen@@ s@@ or .
it hel@@ ps to dete@@ ct and investi@@ gate the tra@@ jec@@ tory of lo@@ a@@ ded partic@@ les ( e.g. electricity or pro@@ ton ) which are sensi@@ tive to mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .
secon@@ dly , the de@@ vice is a cal@@ ori@@ e me@@ ter instal@@ ler .
some cal@@ ori@@ es stop such partic@@ les , like ph@@ ot@@ ons or elec@@ tr@@ ons , but others are designed to stop neu@@ tr@@ ons and ph@@ ot@@ ons .
they measure the partic@@ le energy loss .
aid from st@@ r@@ ands
how to de@@ fine the nature of the al@@ go@@ sa@@ c separ@@ ated from the mechanisms leading to their creation ?
in addition to the standard model of the partic@@ le physi@@ cs ( which result in a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ical pos@@ tural pos@@ tural ) , moder@@ n sci@@ ence concentra@@ ted its hop@@ es fully on the new concep@@ t that would offer a high-@@ level ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical the@@ ory .
this is broad@@ ening the prospe@@ cts for completely new experi@@ ments in C@@ ER@@ N .
standard model ( the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of moder@@ n physi@@ cs , which was used in the 20@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y ) , has to be acc@@ u@@ rate to the acc@@ u@@ rate elements of the le@@ ad@@ ership between the three partic@@ les and the strong and we@@ ak for@@ ces .
this will allow us to provide descri@@ p@@ tions that are very well su@@ ited to what is happ@@ ening in this end@@ less small world .
however , this model does not take into account the f@@ our@@ th intera@@ ction - gra@@ vity .
now , qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m physi@@ cs when the light presents itself with a partic@@ le , ph@@ ot@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y , the gra@@ vity must be trans@@ ferred to another partic@@ le , gra@@ vit@@ on .
on the search for harmon@@ isation
in the light of this partic@@ le model , there is a barri@@ er ( see bo@@ x@@ ing ) .
in addition , Uni@@ ver@@ su@@ m was so extre@@ mely small as well as extre@@ me mass ( total energy and ma@@ inf@@ ra@@ me concentra@@ ted in very small space ) .
consequ@@ ently , the the@@ ory also descri@@ b@@ es the partic@@ les that previ@@ ously domin@@ ated this period , cannot be exclu@@ ded from gra@@ vity .
how do we conne@@ ct to all this general rela@@ tivity the@@ ory ( the E@@ inste@@ in in the first cen@@ tur@@ y ) , which re@@ vol@@ ves completely around gra@@ vity ?
&amp; quot ; The harmon@@ isation of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ics and the overall rela@@ tivity the@@ ory has become the real Hol@@ y Gra@@ il .
re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers are working on this problem .
the most per@@ mit@@ ting way seems to be a st@@ ring the@@ ory . &amp; quot ;
points to points
what does this the@@ ory tell us about the world ?
first of all , this partic@@ les will be re@@ vie@@ wed by the partic@@ les , but as elements that can be compar@@ able with the very small st@@ r@@ ings of 10@@ -@@ 35 met@@ res long ( the number p@@ rece@@ ding the number 1 to 35 ) .
these st@@ ring@@ es vi@@ bra@@ te and the nature of their vi@@ bra@@ tions correspon@@ d to the different types of partic@@ les .
the more st@@ ring vi@@ bra@@ tes , the greater the corresponding partic@@ le energy .
one of the st@@ r@@ ings that is necessary for this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical inte@@ gr@@ ity is super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
to understand what it is , a short description of the basic partic@@ les &amp; quot ; z@@ o@@ ol@@ ogy &amp; quot ; is necessary .
the K@@ van@@ t@@ ke@@ es in the uni@@ verse can be di@@ vi@@ ded into two famili@@ es : on the one hand , there are ph@@ er@@ on@@ ons where electronic electronic and quar@@ ters bel@@ ong to the b@@ os@@ on@@ ons , the other side of the b@@ os@@ on@@ ons , and gra@@ vit@@ on .
Su@@ per@@ me@@ try problem
Su@@ per@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try consis@@ ts of assu@@ mption that each part of the fer@@ mi@@ on family meet@@ s a partic@@ le which bel@@ on@@ gs to the family and vice ver@@ sa , thus sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
the sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c part has not yet been dete@@ cted , but the partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts are hop@@ ing for a high energy impact , which they will soon create , using the L@@ H@@ C , the new partic@@ le speed of C@@ ER@@ N .
in the mean@@ time , as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers can indirec@@ tly monitor the impact of these my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous partic@@ les , as the total mass of g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies and g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies appe@@ ars to be much higher than the g@@ al@@ u@@ ms ( star@@ s , ga@@ ses and similar ) which are dete@@ cted by tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
they therefore pos@@ t@@ p@@ one the presence of in@@ visi@@ ble black mass , which is an intera@@ ction with other ma@@ inf@@ ra@@ mes , and contains very sta@@ ble , so very easy partic@@ les .
there are many key fea@@ tures that the e@@ asi@@ est super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try partic@@ les share .
these may therefore be known as the black mass ing@@ redi@@ ents , the ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on of the first study of S@@ w@@ iss as@@ tron@@ om@@ y in 19@@ 33 by the S@@ w@@ iss Z@@ w@@ ick@@ y .
four intera@@ ctions with single intera@@ ction
the second question , which is proble@@ matic for re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers , concerns a fundamental intera@@ ction between nature four months .
why are their streng@@ ths so different from each other ?
for example , gra@@ vity intera@@ ctions are much we@@ ak@@ er than elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic intera@@ ction .
this pro@@ of is that mag@@ ne@@ tic field alone is enough to draw a rela@@ tively large me@@ tal mass , while the gra@@ vity is needed to move the same mass , while using the same mass .
one question to this question is that all fundamental intera@@ ctions are only one intera@@ ction with an extre@@ mely high energy amount that started at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse .
