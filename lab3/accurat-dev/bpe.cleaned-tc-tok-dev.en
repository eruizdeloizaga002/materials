the purpose of this report is to descri@@ be the steps how Human Res@@ ource Management function should be buil@@ t up – to clari@@ fy the strategy and actions of H@@ R@@ M@@ -@@ plan .
at present the Inves@@ tment depar@@ tment has no H@@ R@@ M function .
the aim of this report was for@@ mu@@ lated with He@@ ad of EU@@ P@@ C@@ U D@@ ace Ro@@ ze in discussion on the 22@@ nd of September .
the con@@ ten@@ ts of the H@@ R@@ M plan were still discussed with other he@@ ads of units : An@@ ita B@@ is@@ of@@ a , Val@@ da Ce@@ pu@@ rite and Val@@ dis B@@ is@@ ters .
the Inves@@ tment De@@ par@@ tment of Mo@@ e is growing ra@@ pid@@ ly and fac@@ ing many changes at present and during the coming next years .
the possible changes of the depar@@ tment organisation are just now under consideration .
the pressure to hand@@ le the working processes as well as staff questions in an effective and correc@@ t way is ur@@ gent .
at present situation the direc@@ tors and he@@ ads of units have so hea@@ vy work@@ lo@@ ads with projects that they har@@ dly have time to develop H@@ R@@ M .
to ap@@ point a person responsible of H@@ R@@ M is highly recommended , so that she / he could concentra@@ te to create a H@@ R – management system and to be able to develop it according to practical needs in the future .
before planning the H@@ R@@ M of the Inves@@ tment depar@@ tment , the vision and mission of the depar@@ tment have to be clear .
it is recommen@@ da@@ ble to review the strategy and short term action plan of the Inves@@ tment depar@@ tment ye@@ arly .
invol@@ vements in EU programmes as well as in national programmes should be emphas@@ ised according to actual needs .
the number of projects is increasing notably and the projects are tur@@ ning more to implementing phase , which impac@@ ts to the number of staff needed and their competence areas .
P@@ im ( Pro@@ ject implementation Manu@@ al ) and PO@@ G ( Pro@@ ject Organ@@ iz@@ ation Gu@@ ide ) are under fin@@ al@@ ising .
they should be in use during this au@@ tu@@ mn .
when produc@@ ing P@@ im different requirements of each funding method must be taken into account , relevant su@@ b processes should be described .
these gu@@ ides will give practical instru@@ ctions to the work f@@ low as well as to the organisation .
these gu@@ ides should be good basis for the next steps like writing job descri@@ p@@ tions and determining competence areas .
the actions needed when creating a H@@ R – management system and when developing it according to practical needs in the future are described in a work f@@ low in Annex III .
the preliminary schedu@@ le for creating H@@ R@@ M@@ -@@ system is shown in Annex IV .
as back@@ ground for the schedu@@ le is assu@@ med that in the beginning of December 2003 the H@@ R-@@ Man@@ ag@@ er / Co@@ ordin@@ ator could start on full time basis to work on developing the H@@ R@@ M .
the direc@@ tor of the depar@@ tment and the he@@ ads of units should work in close co-@@ operation with the H@@ R@@ M@@ -@@ person by for@@ war@@ ding and pri@@ or@@ it@@ ising the needs for continu@@ ous development .
they are also responsible for the develop@@ mental ap@@ pra@@ is@@ al and P@@ L@@ P discussion , the H@@ R@@ M person contribu@@ tes the discus@@ sions by up da@@ ting temp@@ la@@ tes and by keeping data fi@@ les .
an active role is needed from the he@@ ads of units also when determining the top@@ ics and con@@ ten@@ ts for competence areas .
when making the self assessment of compe@@ ten@@ ces the whole staff is involved .
the H@@ R@@ M person coordin@@ ates the competence assessment and kee@@ ps the data fi@@ les .
to the 2004 budget esti@@ mate of the depar@@ tment must be included both the H@@ R@@ M@@ -@@ development costs ( mainly labour costs of H@@ R@@ M person , he@@ ads of units , IT@@ -@@ person ) and implementing costs of training .
implementing costs consis@@ ts of ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ po@@ ck@@ et costs ( e.g. cour@@ ses , le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , material ) , own time for co@@ ach@@ ing and training , working time of the partici@@ pants in training and arran@@ ging and facili@@ ta@@ ting the training by H@@ R@@ M person .
ye@@ arly costs ar@@ ise also from the ap@@ pra@@ is@@ al and P@@ L@@ P discussion in the form of lost working time .
a ro@@ ugh esti@@ mate of training efforts for year 2004 should be done before giving any budget fig@@ ures .

in keeping with an appeal at the March 2005 meeting of the Council , L@@ at@@ via has prepared the National Lisbon Programme for 2005@@ -@@ 2008 ( here@@ in@@ after the “ Programme ” ) , aimed at the promotion of national growth and employment .
the Programme is a policy planning document which shows how , in 2005@@ -@@ 2008 L@@ at@@ via will reach the Lisbon strategy go@@ als on the basis of the In@@ te@@ gra@@ ted guidelines , approved by the Council in July 2005 .
the Programme refle@@ cts the most essential problems for L@@ at@@ via to achieve the Lisbon strategy go@@ als , indic@@ ating the main lines of action and activities to sol@@ ve these problems , as well as performance indicators for achieving the go@@ als .
the Programme is based on policy planning documents approved by the Republic of L@@ at@@ via .
co-@@ ordin@@ ation for developing the Programme was provided by the Su@@ per@@ visory Board of the Lisbon Strategy .
consul@@ tations with the S@@ ae@@ ima ( the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an Parliament ) and social partners were held .
the Programme consis@@ ts of an introduction , main part ( ma@@ cro@@ economic policy , micro@@ economic reforms , employment policy guidelines ) and anne@@ xes .
all nu@@ mer@@ ical information and data , except in cases specifically indicated , were received from the Central Sta@@ tis@@ tical Bureau of the Republic of L@@ at@@ via or from Euro@@ sta@@ t .
in order to fulfil these go@@ als success@@ fully , the development of strategic plans is being implemented by the minis@@ tries , en@@ vis@@ ag@@ ing the preparation of the 2007 budget to be based on strategic planning principles . in accordance with the priorities set by the government , the action strategy of institutions defin@@ es medium-@@ term development go@@ als and direc@@ tions , as well as all the corresponding programmes and sub@@ -@@ programmes of the particular minis@@ try related to these go@@ als and direc@@ tions including their funding .
to ensure successful accession of L@@ at@@ via to the E@@ ur@@ o zone :
on July 21 , 2005 the C@@ ab@@ in@@ et of Minis@@ ters adopted decision to establish govern@@ mental Committee for the In@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion of the European Union Single C@@ ur@@ ren@@ cy in L@@ at@@ via , which has the tas@@ k of working out the plan of necessary measures in order to ensure the successful accession of L@@ at@@ via to the E@@ ur@@ o zone .
on December 31 , 2004 the central government debt reached L@@ V@@ L 9@@ 75 million or 1@@ 3.@@ 3 % of GDP .
it is expected that the central government debt will continue to increase gradu@@ ally in the following years and may reach 1@@ 3.@@ 6 % of GDP in 2008 .
the level of the general government debt in L@@ at@@ via is among the low@@ est in the European Union and is expected to remain consider@@ ably below the gro@@ ss government debt volume criteri@@ on in the medium-@@ term ( 60 % of GDP ) as defined in the M@@ aas@@ tri@@ ch@@ t Treaty .
on the basis of the out@@ lin@@ ed information , it is not ur@@ gent to work out a particular scheme for the reduction of the government debt in the present situation of L@@ at@@ via but , before any action in the area of central government debt management , a care@@ ful analysis of potential risks must be carried out in order to ensure execu@@ tion of the most favou@@ rable transactions for the state .
main planned measures for 2005@@ -@@ 2008 in the area of government debt policy ( gu@@ ide@@ line 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary financial resources for financing the government budget de@@ fic@@ it and re@@ financing the central government debt li@@ abilities at costs as low as possible and under conditions as favou@@ rable as possible , li@@ mit@@ ing financial risks and taking into account the development of L@@ at@@ vi@@ an state capital market and all financial systems ( responsible institution : Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance ) :
– B@@ y working out new debt re@@ purch@@ ase and debt exchange programmes for the management of debt re@@ financing risks , in order to use the opportunities off@@ ered by capital markets to attra@@ ct low@@ -@@ cost long-term resources ;
– B@@ y continu@@ ing the started reduction of external government debt servi@@ cing costs , all existing provisions of foreign lo@@ an contracts will be evalu@@ ated , in order to assess the opportunities and existing restrictions on the anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted re@@ payment of several lo@@ ans in the future by re@@ financing these lo@@ ans with other more favou@@ rable lo@@ ans , or on possible changes in lo@@ an contract provisions .
sustainability of L@@ at@@ vi@@ an public finan@@ ces can be evalu@@ ated posi@@ tively and is character@@ ised by a rela@@ tively low level of the government debt , as well as adequate fiscal dis@@ cip@@ line .
L@@ at@@ via &apos;s commitment to fulfil the requirements of the Sta@@ bility and Gro@@ w@@ th P@@ act , as well as the go@@ al to jo@@ in the E@@ ur@@ o area is another additional guarantee for ste@@ ad@@ iness of the positive tr@@ ends , relating to the existing fiscal position .
from the long-term perspe@@ ctive , sustainability of public finan@@ ces will be mo@@ stly affected by the population &apos;s a@@ ge@@ ing process , resulting in a dec@@ rea@@ sed number and propor@@ tion of ab@@ le@@ -@@ bo@@ died people and in increased demo@@ gra@@ phic load .
initial calcu@@ lations of financial sustainability show that the population &apos;s a@@ ge@@ ing will have an impact on L@@ at@@ vi@@ an society , national economy and public finan@@ ces , but , due to the effec@@ ted pension reform , this impact will not create in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table consequences .
the low level of L@@ at@@ via &apos;s government debt and growing expenditure pressure also provides certain flexi@@ bility for the government , pre@@ ser@@ ving stability of public finan@@ ces .
however , it has to be noted that the population a@@ ge@@ ing crea@@ tes new challenges for the heal@@ th@@ - care system .
brea@@ k@@ down of heal@@ th@@ care expenditure by age groups clearly shows that the higher costs fall on ol@@ der people , whose number will significantly increase within the next 50 years .
long-term care exp@@ endi@@ tures in L@@ at@@ via are currently quite low , determined both by the limited central and local government resources to be sp@@ ent for this purpose , as well as the tradi@@ tions and values of the society .
at the same time , health of other demo@@ gra@@ phic groups has to be ensu@@ red as well , because the overall si@@ ck@@ ness rate is high .
the government is for@@ mu@@ lating an efficient heal@@ th@@ care system based on a long-term perspe@@ ctive .
changes in public finance policy will be required in the future to ad@@ just the budget for a substanti@@ ally different demo@@ gra@@ phic situation .
as the demo@@ gra@@ phic load will increase in the more dist@@ ant future , GDP growth based on growing labour produc@@ tivity will play a decisi@@ ve role in the rise of the living standard of all population groups .
therefore it is important to ensure training of L@@ at@@ via &apos;s main res@@ ource – human resources – in accordance with labour market requirements , to create an inc@@ lusive labour market ( see Section 3 ) .
fo@@ rest substanti@@ ally contribu@@ tes to the overall development of L@@ at@@ via &apos;s national economy , as it meet@@ s the requirements of raw materials for ti@@ mber processing , which is one of the lar@@ gest export sectors of L@@ at@@ vi@@ an industry .
fo@@ rest is also an important res@@ ource for development of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side because it provides sub@@ sis@@ tence to local in@@ ha@@ bit@@ ants working in various fields of action , for about 150 tho@@ us@@ and fo@@ rest ow@@ ners and fo@@ rest@@ -@@ related enterprises .
part of the prof@@ it ga@@ ined in final fel@@ ling , thin@@ ning or services is inves@@ ted by a fo@@ rest ow@@ ner into con@@ servation of fo@@ rest value or implementation of continu@@ ous production .
the big@@ gest fo@@ rest ow@@ ners ( state , local governments and some private fo@@ rest@@ ry companies , ow@@ ning tho@@ us@@ ands of he@@ c@@ ta@@ res of fo@@ rest areas ) can ensure a continu@@ ous process of production throughout the long fo@@ rest management cy@@ cle .
in small fo@@ rest proper@@ ties , taking into account the com@@ position of t@@ ree species , age , structure , former management practices , the economic situation in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side as well as the knowledge of fo@@ rest ow@@ ners , the practice of continu@@ ous fo@@ rest@@ ry production is no@@ tic@@ e@@ ably hin@@ dered .
due to the abo@@ ve@@ -@@ mentioned circumstances , at present an insu@@ ffici@@ ent amount of investment ( prof@@ it ) is chan@@ nel@@ led into re@@ production of fo@@ rest value in the private fo@@ rest@@ ry , therefore it is necessary to promote the rise of fo@@ rest stand@@ s &apos; produc@@ tivity ( ti@@ mely and high-@@ quality renew@@ al of fo@@ rest , use of sele@@ cted fo@@ rest re@@ produc@@ tive material in renew@@ al of fo@@ rest , ten@@ ding of young fo@@ rest stand@@ s etc . ) , especially in private fo@@ res@@ ts .
although waste management systems in L@@ at@@ via have been improved , and society &apos;s awareness of the nec@@ essi@@ ty to reduce waste increa@@ ses , the volume of gener@@ ated waste continu@@ es to rise every year .
opportunities for waste processing and u@@ tilis@@ ation are insu@@ ffici@@ ent , although enterprises receive subsi@@ dies , through tender from the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an Environ@@ mental Protection Fund for the collection and u@@ tilis@@ ation of re@@ si@@ due from environ@@ men@@ tally har@@ m@@ ful goods and products .
infrastructure of water management ( water supply and se@@ w@@ age collection and treatment ) is insu@@ ffici@@ ently developed and out@@ dated , its capacity is not justified econom@@ ically , technologies u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed are ener@@ g@@ y-@@ inten@@ sive and do not comply with all environmental requirements .
this restric@@ ts business development , especially in the peri@@ ph@@ ery of the country .
acc@@ essi@@ bility to water management infrastructure very no@@ tic@@ e@@ ably affec@@ ts the development of the public u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties sp@@ here , public ca@@ tering , heal@@ th@@ care and the tour@@ ism industry .
L@@ at@@ via must set a dead@@ line to trans@@ pose Internal Market direc@@ tives as well as ensure the supervision and co-@@ ordin@@ ation of direc@@ tives &apos; trans@@ position at the public administration level and political level .
as of September 7 , 2005 , L@@ at@@ via had not announced trans@@ position of 1.3 % of EU direc@@ tives ( or 0.@@ 5 % of the total number of direc@@ tives ) .
taking into account that 9@@ 9.@@ 5 % of direc@@ tives were trans@@ posed into the nor@@ ma@@ tive acts of L@@ at@@ via as of September 7 , 2005 , this fully ensu@@ res meeting the Lisbon go@@ al of Trans@@ pos@@ ing at least 9@@ 8.@@ 5 % of direc@@ tives , or to allow a trans@@ position de@@ fic@@ it for direc@@ tives to the amount of 1.@@ 5 % .
trans@@ position of Internal Market direc@@ tives and implementation of the relevant legal acts directly depend@@ s on establishing a common system for super@@ vis@@ ing the trans@@ position of EU legal acts .
at present , no efficient comprehensive data base for the super@@ vis@@ ing the trans@@ position of EU legal acts has been established , which would provide an opportunity to follow up the direc@@ tives &apos; trans@@ position process at several reference points in due time , h@@ ence , be@@ side other circumstances , the process of direc@@ tives &apos; trans@@ position s@@ low@@ s down and the creation of a nor@@ ma@@ tive base of the EU Internal Market is en@@ cu@@ mb@@ ered .
limited human resources of public administration institutions reduce their ability for a qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tively and ti@@ mely controlled compliance of EU direc@@ tives &apos; trans@@ position process with the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an legal system .
restrictions to the EU Internal Market fre@@ ed@@ oms were lar@@ gel@@ y elimin@@ ated before L@@ at@@ via &apos;s accession to the EU , however , ob@@ sta@@ cles to cross-border transactions continue to exist .
essential hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ces are created by the existing requirements for business licen@@ sing and cu@@ mber@@ some administrative procedures , which require additional financial and time resources from en@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s and affect most nega@@ tively the small and medium-@@ si@@ zed enterprises .
thus it is necessary to analy@@ ze the val@@ idity and compliance with EU requirements of separate existing systems of licen@@ sing and other restrictions , including the requirements and val@@ idity of the current restrictions for the liber@@ al professi@@ ons ( law@@ yers , no@@ tari@@ es , accoun@@ tan@@ ts , ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ cts , eng@@ ine@@ ers and pharma@@ c@@ is@@ ts ) , in order to promote competitiveness in these sectors .
to implement a single and harmonised competition policy , in 2004 the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an nor@@ ma@@ tive acts of competition were harmonised in compliance with the requirements of the EU competition standards .
in case of cross-border je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy of competition or for prevention of potential competition dis@@ tor@@ tions , the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an competition protection body – the Com@@ peti@@ tion Council – has started active co-@@ operation with the European Commission and competition protection bodies of EU Member States .
the electricity market is being opened gradu@@ ally .
as of July 1 , 2004 the thre@@ sh@@ old for eligi@@ bility of a legal entity to the status of a quali@@ fied eligible cus@@ to@@ mer was set at the 0.@@ 0 G@@ W@@ h .
there@@ by at present only ho@@ use@@ hol@@ ds are not allowed to choo@@ se the suppli@@ er , and the electricity market opening is ensu@@ red up to 75 % .
none of the eligible cus@@ tom@@ ers has changed suppli@@ ers of electricity up to now .
in order to acti@@ vate competition and encourage entry of alternative suppli@@ ers in the market , it is necessary to separate leg@@ ally and fun@@ ction@@ ally electricity transmission and distribution fun@@ ctions from the electricity production and sale fun@@ ctions .
conditions for the electri@@ c power supply structure are defined in the E@@ le@@ c@@ tri@@ city Market La@@ w .
using only 1 % of its overall we@@ alth each year , the EU is building our common future and as@@ sum@@ ing global responsibilities .
the focus of sp@@ ending decisions is on meeting the challenges of the moder@@ n world to our society in the interests of a better life for the citizens of the EU .
the European Parliament is the only direc@@ t@@ l@@ y-@@ ele@@ cted body of the European Union . the 7@@ 36 Members of the European Parliament are there to re@@ present you , the citiz@@ en . they are ele@@ cted once every five years by vo@@ ters right across the 27 Member States of the European Union on behalf of its 500 million citizens .
in this part of our website , you can find information on how the Parliament organis@@ es its work , through a system of speci@@ alised committees . the work of the European Parliament is important because in many policy areas , decisions on new European laws are made jo@@ in@@ tly by Parliament and the Council of Minis@@ ters , which re@@ presents Member States .
Parliament pla@@ ys an active role in draf@@ ting legislation which has an impact on the daily lives of its citizens : for example , on environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport , and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods . Parliament also has joint power with the Council over the annual budget of the European Union .
the European Parliament is made up of 7@@ 36 Members ele@@ cted in the 27 Member States of the enlar@@ ged European Union .
since 19@@ 79 MEPs have been ele@@ cted by direct univer@@ sal suff@@ ra@@ ge for a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year period .
each Member State deci@@ des on the form its ele@@ ction will take , but follows id@@ en@@ tical democratic gro@@ und@@ rules : equality of the se@@ xes and a secret bal@@ lot .
in all Member States , the voting age is 18 , with the excep@@ tion of Austria , where it is 16 .
European elections are already gover@@ ned by a number of common principles : direct univer@@ sal suff@@ ra@@ ge , propor@@ tional represen@@ tation and a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year renewable term .
the sea@@ ts are , as a general rule , sha@@ red out proportion@@ ately to the population of each Member State .
each Member State has a set number of sea@@ ts , the maximum being 99 and the minimum five .
equality of men and women : the propor@@ tion of women in the European Parliament has ris@@ en ste@@ adi@@ ly .
at present sli@@ ght@@ ly over one third of MEPs are women .
MEPs di@@ vide their time between Brussels , S@@ tras@@ bour@@ g and their constitu@@ en@@ cies . in Brussels they atten@@ d meetings of the parliamentary committees and political groups , and additional plenary si@@ t@@ t@@ ings . in S@@ tras@@ bour@@ g they atten@@ d 12 plenary si@@ t@@ t@@ ings .
in par@@ alle@@ l with these activities they must also , of course , de@@ vote time to their constitu@@ en@@ cies .
the Members of the European Parliament are gro@@ up@@ ed by political af@@ fin@@ ity and not by nation@@ ality .
they exercise their mandate in an independent f@@ as@@ hi@@ on .
members of the European Parliament , whose powers have become more and more exten@@ sive , influ@@ ence every area of the day to day life of the European public : the environment , consumer protection and transport , as well as education , culture , health etc .
the new Sta@@ tute for Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 . the new Sta@@ tute makes the terms and conditions of MEPs &apos; work more transparent and introduc@@ es a common sal@@ ary for all Members paid from the EU budget .
in the European Parliament , all Community languages are equ@@ ally important : all parliamentary documents are published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and every ME@@ P has the right to speak in the official language of his / her choice .
what better way to guarantee the transparency and acc@@ essi@@ bility of Parliament &apos;s work for all members of the general public .
fir@@ m@@ ly roo@@ ted in the European t@@ rea@@ ties , multi@@ l@@ ingu@@ al@@ ism is the refle@@ ction of the cultural and l@@ ingu@@ is@@ tic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes the European institutions more acc@@ es@@ sible and transparent for the general public , which constitu@@ tes a guarantee for the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament diff@@ ers from the other EU institutions through its obligation to ensure the high@@ est possible degree of multi@@ l@@ ingu@@ al@@ ism .
all EU citizens must be able to ref@@ er to legislation directly concerning them in the language of their country .
furthermore , since every European citiz@@ en has the right to stand for ele@@ ction to the European Parliament , it is un@@ reasonable to require Members to have a perfect com@@ m@@ and of one of the common languages .
the right of each Member to read parliamentary documents , to follow deba@@ tes and to speak in his / her own language is expres@@ s@@ ly recognised in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , in its role as legis@@ la@@ tor the European Parliament is obli@@ ged to guarantee that the l@@ ingu@@ is@@ tic quality of all the laws which it adop@@ ts is beyond re@@ pro@@ ach in all official languages .
the Treaty provisions also allow all European citizens to follow Parliament &apos;s work , to ask questions and to receive re@@ pli@@ es in their own language .
the European Parliament , in its resolution of 9 October , decla@@ red that “ the experience ga@@ ined from past European elections and refer@@ endu@@ ms sugges@@ ts that those who are aware of , and interested in , EU issues are more likely to participate , while those who are not as well informed are less likely to do so ” .
on the eve of the European E@@ le@@ ctions 2009 , Parliament , Council and Commission approved in October this year a Joint Dec@@ lar@@ ation on Communic@@ ating Europe in Partnership to st@@ ress that communic@@ ating on the European Union requires the political commitment of EU Institu@@ tions and Member States at all levels .
the main aim of the Joint Dec@@ lar@@ ation is to give citizens access to fair and di@@ verse information about the EU to enable them to acti@@ vely participate in the public debate on European Union issues .
with this Joint Dec@@ lar@@ ation , the EU Institu@@ tions committed themselves to addres@@ sing the communication challenge on EU issues in partnership with the Member States to ensure communication with the w@@ idest possible audi@@ ence at the appropriate level .
in doing so , they expressed the inten@@ tion to develop sy@@ ner@@ gies with national , regional and local authorities as well as with representatives of civil society .
although each Member State and each Institu@@ tion is responsible for its own communication strategy and priorities , Parliament , Council and Commission agreed to jo@@ in@@ tly identify a limited number of common communication priorities for each year .
finally , the Commission is invi@@ ted to report back at the beginning of each year to the other EU Institu@@ tions on the main achie@@ vements of the implementation of the common communication priorities of the previous year .
the European Union is set up with the aim of ending the frequ@@ ent and bloo@@ dy w@@ ars between neigh@@ b@@ ours , which cul@@ min@@ ated in the Se@@ con@@ d World W@@ ar .
as of 19@@ 50 , the European Co@@ al and S@@ teel Community begin@@ s to un@@ ite European countries econom@@ ically and poli@@ tically in order to secure las@@ ting peace .
the six foun@@ ders are Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Luxembourg and the Netherlands .
the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s are domin@@ ated by a c@@ old war between e@@ ast and w@@ est .
prote@@ s@@ ts in Hung@@ ary against the Commun@@ ist regime are put down by So@@ vi@@ et tan@@ ks in 19@@ 56 ; while the following year , 19@@ 57 , the So@@ vi@@ et Union takes the lead in the space ra@@ ce , when it laun@@ ches the first man@@ -@@ made space satelli@@ te , S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik 1 .
also in 19@@ 57 , the Treaty of R@@ ome crea@@ tes the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , or ‘ Common Market ’ .
the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s sees the emer@@ gence of ‘ y@@ outh culture ’ , with groups such as The Be@@ at@@ les attra@@ cting hu@@ ge cro@@ w@@ ds of teen@@ age f@@ ans where@@ ver they appear , hel@@ ping to stimu@@ late a cultural re@@ volu@@ tion and w@@ id@@ ening the gener@@ ation ga@@ p .
it is a good period for the economy , hel@@ ped by the fact that EU countries stop char@@ ging cus@@ tom duties when they trade with each other .
they also agree joint control over food production , so that everybody now has enough to eat - and soon there is even sur@@ plus agricultural produce .
may 19@@ 68 be@@ comes fa@@ m@@ ous for stu@@ dent ri@@ o@@ ts in Par@@ is , and many changes in society and beha@@ vi@@ our become associated with the so@@ -@@ called ‘ 68 gener@@ ation ’ .
Den@@ mark , Ireland and the United Kingdom jo@@ in the European Union on 1 January 19@@ 73 , ra@@ ising the number of member states to n@@ ine .
the short , yet b@@ ru@@ tal , Ara@@ b@@ -@@ Is@@ ra@@ eli war of October 19@@ 73 result in an energy crisis and economic problems in Europe .
the last ri@@ ght@@ -@@ wing dic@@ ta@@ tor@@ ships in Europe come to an end with the over@@ thro@@ w of the S@@ ala@@ z@@ ar regime in Portugal in 19@@ 74 and the death of General Fran@@ co of Spain in 19@@ 75 .
the EU regional policy star@@ ts to transfer hu@@ ge su@@ ms to create jobs and infrastructure in po@@ ore@@ r areas .
the European Parliament increa@@ ses its influ@@ ence in EU a@@ ffairs and in 19@@ 79 all citizens can , for the first time , ele@@ ct their members directly .
the Pol@@ ish trade uni@@ on , S@@ oli@@ dar@@ no@@ ś@@ ć , and its lea@@ der L@@ ech Wal@@ es@@ a , become ho@@ use@@ hold names across Europe and the world following the G@@ d@@ ans@@ k shi@@ p@@ y@@ ard stri@@ kes in the sum@@ mer of 19@@ 80 .
in 19@@ 81 , Greece be@@ comes the 10@@ th member of the EU and Spain and Portugal follow five years later .
in 19@@ 87 the Single European Act is signed .
this is a t@@ reaty which provides the basis for a vast si@@ x@@ -@@ year programme aimed at sor@@ ting out the problems with the free@@ -@@ f@@ low of trade across EU borders and thus crea@@ tes the ‘ Single Market ’ .
there is major political up@@ he@@ ava@@ l when , on 9 November 19@@ 89 , the Ber@@ lin W@@ all is pul@@ led down and the border between E@@ ast and W@@ est Germany is opened for the first time in 28 years .
with the col@@ lapse of commun@@ ism across central and eas@@ tern Europe , Europe@@ ans become clo@@ ser neigh@@ b@@ ours .
in 199@@ 3 the Single Market is completed with the the &apos; four fre@@ ed@@ oms &apos; of : movement of goods , services , people and money .
the 199@@ 0@@ s is also the de@@ ca@@ de of two t@@ rea@@ ties , the ‘ M@@ aas@@ tri@@ ch@@ t ’ Treaty on European Union in 199@@ 3 and the Treaty of A@@ m@@ s@@ ter@@ dam in 1999 .
people are concerned about how to protect the environment and also how Europe@@ ans can act together when it comes to security and defence matters .
in 199@@ 5 the EU ga@@ ins three more new members , Austria , Fin@@ land and Swe@@ den .
a small vil@@ la@@ ge in Luxembourg gives its name to the ‘ Schen@@ gen ’ agreements that gradu@@ ally allow people to travel without having their pas@@ spor@@ ts che@@ cked at the borders .
mil@@ li@@ ons of young people study in other countries with EU support .
communication is made e@@ asi@@ er as more and more people start using mo@@ bile ph@@ ones and the inter@@ net .
the euro is the new currency for many Europe@@ ans .
the political di@@ v@@ isions between e@@ ast and w@@ est Europe are finally decla@@ red heal@@ ed when no fe@@ wer than 10 new countries jo@@ in the EU in 2004 .
many people think that it is time for Europe to have a constitu@@ tion but what sor@@ t of constitu@@ tion is by no means easy to agree , so the debate on the future of Europe ra@@ ges on .
the single currency , the euro , allow@@ s you to compar@@ e prices directly in all the countries that use it .
travel between euro countries is e@@ asi@@ er because the costs and in@@ conven@@ i@@ ence of chan@@ ging money have dis@@ appea@@ red .
competition introduced by the fron@@ ti@@ er@@ -@@ free single market has dri@@ ven quality up and prices down .
phone calls , Internet access and air travel are c@@ hea@@ per .
as consumers , EU rules protect you from fa@@ ul@@ ty or sub@@ standard products whether you buy lo@@ c@@ ally or in another country .
the EU also sets the high@@ est standards for food safety .
EU citizens can live , work , study and re@@ ti@@ re in another EU country .
temporary restrictions for workers from the 12 ne@@ w@@ est member states are gradu@@ ally being remo@@ ved .
more than two million young people have already used EU programmes to study or tra@@ in in another European country .
as a result , the EU schemes for edu@@ cational ex@@ changes and trans@@ -@@ border partner@@ ships like E@@ ras@@ mus and Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do are b@@ y@@ words among stu@@ dents and other lear@@ ners .
the EU does not decide what you lear@@ n in school , but it does work to ensure that your edu@@ cational and professional quali@@ fications are proper@@ ly recognised in other EU countries .
a heal@@ thy environment is a big issue for Europe@@ ans and their governments .
this is why the EU is spe@@ ar@@ heading world efforts to protect the environment and fight climate change .
as pollu@@ tion knows no borders , EU member states have taken joint action in many areas .
it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing then that Europe &apos;s ri@@ vers and be@@ aches are cle@@ an@@ er , vehicles pollu@@ te less , and there are stri@@ ct rules for waste disposal .
dangerous waste from Europe can no longer be dump@@ ed in poor countries .
there are also t@@ ough EU rules to ensure that chemi@@ c@@ als used by companies are safe for people and the environment .
the EU wants key activities like transport , industry , agriculture and tour@@ ism to be organised in such a way that they can be developed without destro@@ ying our natural resources — in short ‘ sustainable development ’ .
in an effort to put an end to climate change , EU le@@ ad@@ ers have agreed on t@@ ough measures to reduce gre@@ en@@ house gas e@@ mission by 20 % by 2020 .
energy re@@ presents the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of the EU &apos;s long-term climate change policy and the EU has set binding targets to increase the use of clean , renewable energy sources such as win@@ d , Hy@@ dro@@ power or so@@ lar energy .
this will not only help fight climate change , but will also boo@@ st the economy and ensure a more sta@@ ble supply of energy , making Europe less reli@@ ant on foreign oil and gas imports .
the EU has already put into place an innovative ‘ e@@ mission trading scheme ’ , where@@ by ener@@ g@@ y-@@ inten@@ sive companies which cut their emissions are re@@ warded and those who exceed the given limits are pen@@ alised .
the euro ( € ) is probably the EU &apos;s most tan@@ gi@@ ble achie@@ vement .
the single currency is sha@@ red by 16 countries ( 2009 ) , represen@@ ting over two thir@@ ds of the EU population .
others will follow once their econom@@ ies are ready .
all euro notes and co@@ ins can be used in the countries where the euro is accepted .
each note is the same , while the co@@ ins have a common design on one side and a national emb@@ le@@ m of their country of origin on the other side .
these EU countries use the euro : Austria , Belgium , Cy@@ pr@@ us , Fin@@ land , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Malta , the Netherlands , Portugal , Slova@@ kia , Sloven@@ ia and Spain .
our society is fa@@ ire@@ r and more efficient when we do not dis@@ crimin@@ ate against fel@@ low human be@@ ings because of their nation@@ ality , gender , han@@ di@@ ca@@ p , ra@@ ce or other factors .
that is why EU law b@@ ans discrimination .
as long ago as the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , the first EU t@@ rea@@ ties contained a cle@@ ar@@ -@@ cut rule that men and women must have equal pay for equal work .
this has given the EU a pi@@ one@@ ering role in the fight for women &apos;s rights , which are now an integra@@ l part of all EU policies .
to tack@@ le cross-border crime and terrorism , EU countries have taken steps to ensure full cooperation between their police and customs offic@@ ers , im@@ migration services and law cour@@ ts .
one practical step has been to introduce a European ar@@ rest war@@ r@@ ant , to make it e@@ asi@@ er to transfer sus@@ pe@@ cted crimin@@ als from the country where they have been ar@@ res@@ ted to the country where they are wanted for ques@@ tion@@ ing or to stand trial .
EU countries are also coordin@@ ating asylum policies and ti@@ gh@@ tening controls at the EU &apos;s external fron@@ ti@@ ers .
since EU citizens are free to live in any member country , they must have equal access to justice every@@ where in the EU .
member governments have to ensure that they all apply EU laws in the same way , and that court rul@@ ings in one country can be enfor@@ ced in another .
the EU has done a lot to make it e@@ asi@@ er to sol@@ ve cross-border legal problems involving mar@@ ri@@ age , separ@@ ation , di@@ vor@@ ce and the cus@@ to@@ dy of children , as well as other kin@@ ds of civil dispu@@ tes .
new skills are needed too , and we must all sp@@ end more time learning throughout our lives .

war between EU countries is now un@@ thin@@ ka@@ ble , thanks to the un@@ ity that has been buil@@ t up between them over the last 50 years .
given this success , the EU is now working to spread peace and stability beyond its borders .
the best way to prevent confli@@ cts from ar@@ ising in the first place is to create greater pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity wor@@ ld@@ wide .
as the world &apos;s lar@@ gest trading power , the EU is using its influ@@ ence to establish fair rules for world trade .
it wants to make sure that glob@@ alisation also benefits the po@@ o@@ rest countries .
the EU already provides more humanita@@ rian assistance and development aid than anyone else .
the EU s@@ ends military and police missions as pe@@ ac@@ e@@ kee@@ pers to trou@@ ble@@ -@@ spo@@ ts such as the Bal@@ kan@@ s , for example .
this is part of the defence aspe@@ ct of the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
the European Union shows how democratic countries can success@@ fully pool economic and political resources in the common interest , ser@@ ving as a possible model to be followed in other parts of the world .

since its creation by six foun@@ ding members over 50 years ago , the European Union has attra@@ cted a con@@ st@@ ant st@@ ream of ne@@ w@@ com@@ ers , cul@@ min@@ ating in its his@@ tor@@ ic ex@@ pan@@ sion from 15 to 27 in 2004 and 2007 , which uni@@ ted a contin@@ ent s@@ pli@@ t by the C@@ old W@@ ar for 45 years .

he was not his father &apos;s only son , though he was the el@@ der ; his brother , Wil@@ lia@@ m , was a sa@@ w@@ yer with his own business down along the St@@ . Phi@@ li@@ p &apos;s bank of the A@@ v@@ on ne@@ ar C@@ u@@ c@@ ko@@ ld &apos;s P@@ ill and the glas@@ sho@@ uses , and he had three sis@@ ters all satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily married to F@@ ree M@@ en .
there were nes@@ ts of M@@ organ@@ s in several parts of the city , but the M@@ organ@@ s of Richard &apos;s cla@@ n -- perhaps e@@ mig@@ rants from Wal@@ es in long ago times -- had been re@@ sident for enough gener@@ ations to have ga@@ ined some standing ; indeed , cla@@ n lu@@ min@@ aries like Co@@ us@@ in Ja@@ mes@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ dru@@ g@@ g@@ ist hea@@ ded significant enterprises , bel@@ on@@ ged to the Mer@@ ch@@ ant V@@ en@@ ture@@ rs and the Cor@@ po@@ ration , gave he@@ f@@ ty don@@ ations to the po@@ or@@ ho@@ uses , and hop@@ ed one day to be Ma@@ y@@ or .
Richard &apos;s father was not a cla@@ n lu@@ min@@ ary . nor was he a cla@@ n dis@@ gra@@ ce .
after some ele@@ mentary s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing he had ser@@ ved his time as an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce vi@@ c@@ tu@@ al@@ ler , then , certific@@ ated and a F@@ ree M@@ an who had paid his fine , he stru@@ g@@ g@@ led to@@ ward the go@@ al of keeping his own ta@@ ver@@ n .
a soci@@ ally accep@@ table mar@@ ri@@ age had been arran@@ ged for him ; Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t B@@ ig@@ gs came from good farm@@ ing stock ne@@ ar B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster and enjo@@ yed the c@@ ach@@ et of being able to read , though she could not w@@ rite .
the children , commen@@ cing with a girl , came along at inter@@ val@@ s too frequ@@ ent to ren@@ der the gri@@ ef of lo@@ sing an oc@@ c@@ asi@@ onal child tr@@ uly un@@ be@@ ar@@ able .
when D@@ ick lear@@ ned sufficient control to with@@ draw before e@@ j@@ ac@@ ula@@ ting , the children ce@@ ased at two living s@@ ons , three living da@@ ugh@@ ters .
a good bro@@ od , small enough to make providing for them fe@@ asi@@ ble .
di@@ ck wanted at least one fully li@@ te@@ rate son , and cen@@ tered his hop@@ es on Richard when it be@@ came ap@@ par@@ ent that Wil@@ lia@@ m , two years youn@@ ger , was no s@@ cho@@ lar .
so when Richard turned seven he was en@@ rol@@ led at Col@@ st@@ on &apos;s Sch@@ ool for Bo@@ ys and don@@ ned the fa@@ m@@ ous blu@@ e co@@ at which informed B@@ ris@@ to@@ li@@ ans that his father was poor but respe@@ c@@ table , sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly Ch@@ ur@@ ch of Eng@@ land .
and over the course of the next five years li@@ tera@@ cy and nu@@ mer@@ acy were dru@@ m@@ med into him .
he lear@@ ned to w@@ rite a fair hand , do su@@ ms in his head , plo@@ d through Ca@@ es@@ ar &apos;s G@@ alli@@ c W@@ ar , C@@ ic@@ er@@ o &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ches , and O@@ vid &apos;s Me@@ ta@@ mor@@ p@@ ho@@ ses , stimu@@ lated by the ac@@ id sting of the c@@ ane and the ca@@ us@@ tic bi@@ te of the mas@@ ter &apos;s comments .
since he was a good though not sh@@ ining s@@ cho@@ lar and ow@@ ned into the bar@@ ga@@ in a qu@@ i@@ et attra@@ c@@ tiveness , he survi@@ ved the late Mr. Col@@ st@@ on &apos;s ph@@ il@@ an@@ thro@@ pi@@ c institution better than most , and got more out of it .
at tw@@ el@@ ve , it was time to leave and es@@ po@@ use a trade or craft in keeping with his education .
much to the sur@@ prise of his relations , he went in a different direc@@ tion than any Mor@@ gan thus far .
among his ch@@ ie@@ f assets was a tal@@ ent for things mechan@@ ical , for pu@@ tting together the pi@@ ec@@ es of a pu@@ zz@@ le ; and alli@@ ed to that was a pati@@ ence tr@@ uly re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble in one so young .
of his own choice , he was app@@ ren@@ tic@@ ed to S@@ enh@@ or To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s the gun@@ s@@ mit@@ h .
this decision secre@@ tly ple@@ ased his father , who lik@@ ed the idea of the M@@ organ@@ s &apos; produc@@ ing an ar@@ tis@@ an rather than a tra@@ de@@ sman .
be@@ sides which , war was a part of life , and gun@@ s a part of war .
a man who could make and men@@ d them was un@@ likely to become c@@ ann@@ on fo@@ d@@ der on a bat@@ tle@@ field .
for Richard , the seven years of his app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p were a jo@@ y when it came to the work and the learning , even if a tri@@ f@@ le on the che@@ er@@ less side when it came to physical com@@ for@@ t .
like all app@@ ren@@ tices , he was not paid , li@@ ved in his mas@@ ter &apos;s house , wa@@ ited on him at his table , d@@ ined off the sc@@ rap@@ s , and s@@ lep@@ t on the flo@@ or .
lu@@ ck@@ ily S@@ enh@@ or To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was a kind mas@@ ter and a super@@ b gun@@ s@@ mit@@ h .
though he could make g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous du@@ el@@ ing p@@ ist@@ ols and spor@@ ting gun@@ s , he was sh@@ re@@ w@@ d enough to re@@ ali@@ ze that in order to prospe@@ r in those areas he must needs be a Man@@ ton , and a Man@@ ton he could not be outside of Lon@@ don .
so he had set@@ tled for making the military mus@@ ket known affec@@ tion@@ ately to every sol@@ di@@ er and mar@@ ine as “ Bro@@ wn B@@ ess , ” all 46 in@@ ches of her -- be they w@@ ood of stock or ste@@ el of bar@@ re@@ l -- bro@@ wn as a nu@@ t .
at n@@ ine@@ teen Richard was certific@@ ated and mo@@ ved out of the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s ho@@ use@@ hold , though not out of the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s work@@ sho@@ p .
there he continued , a mas@@ ter cra@@ f@@ ts@@ man now , to make Bro@@ wn B@@ ess .
and he married , something he was not allowed to do while an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce .
his wife was the child of his mother &apos;s brother and therefore his own first co@@ us@@ in , but as the Ch@@ ur@@ ch of Eng@@ land had no objec@@ tion to that , he wed his bri@@ de in St@@ . James &apos;s ch@@ ur@@ ch under the aus@@ pic@@ es of Co@@ us@@ in Ja@@ mes@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ cle@@ r@@ gy .
though arran@@ ged , it had been a love mat@@ ch , and the couple had only f@@ alle@@ n more dee@@ ply in love as the years rol@@ led on .
not without some difficulties of n@@ omen@@ cla@@ ture , for Richard Mor@@ gan , son of Richard Mor@@ gan and Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t B@@ ig@@ gs , had taken another Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t B@@ ig@@ gs to wife .
while the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s gun@@ s@@ mi@@ thy had th@@ ri@@ ved that had not been so aw@@ k@@ ward , for the young pa@@ ir li@@ ved in a tw@@ o-@@ roo@@ med ren@@ ted a@@ par@@ tment on T@@ emp@@ le S@@ tre@@ et across the A@@ v@@ on , just around the cor@@ ner from the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s work@@ sho@@ p and the Je@@ wish sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue .
the mar@@ ri@@ age had taken place in 17@@ 67 , three years after the Se@@ ven Ye@@ ars &apos; W@@ ar against France had been concluded by an un@@ popu@@ lar peace ; hea@@ vil@@ y in debt despite vi@@ c@@ tory , Eng@@ land had to increase her re@@ venu@@ es by additional tax@@ es and dec@@ rease the cost of her ar@@ my and na@@ vy by mas@@ sive re@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ments .
gun@@ s were no longer necessary . so one by one the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s ar@@ tis@@ ans and app@@ ren@@ tices dis@@ appea@@ red until the establishment consis@@ ted of Richard and S@@ enh@@ or To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s him@@ self .
then finally , just after the bir@@ th of little M@@ ary in 17@@ 70 , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ tly obli@@ ged to let Richard go .
“ Come and work for me , ” D@@ ick Mor@@ gan had said cor@@ di@@ ally .
“ G@@ un@@ s may come and go , but ru@@ m is absolu@@ tely e@@ ternal . ”
it had ans@@ wered very well , despite the problem with names .
Richard &apos;s mother had always been known as Ma@@ g and Richard &apos;s wife as Pe@@ g , two di@@ minu@@ tives for Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t .
the real trouble was that save for qu@@ ir@@ ky Pro@@ te@@ st@@ ant Dis@@ sen@@ ters who ch@@ ris@@ ten@@ ed their male pro@@ gen@@ y “ C@@ ran@@ field ” or “ O@@ ne@@ si@@ ph@@ or@@ us , ” almost every male in Eng@@ land was John , Wil@@ lia@@ m , Hen@@ ry , Richard , James or T@@ ho@@ mas , and almost every fe@@ male was An@@ n , Ca@@ ther@@ ine , Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t , E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ eth or M@@ ary .
one of the few customs which emb@@ ra@@ ced every class from high@@ est to low@@ est .
“ I &apos;ve never seen anything like it before ! ”
the words came from a d@@ ry su@@ ited di@@ ver who had just sur@@ fac@@ ed behind the s@@ tern of the research ves@@ sel , his voice brea@@ th@@ less with ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment .
after s@@ w@@ im@@ ming over to the la@@ d@@ der , he remo@@ ved his fin@@ s and mas@@ k and pas@@ sed them up to the waiting bar@@ ge ch@@ ie@@ f .
he ha@@ u@@ led him@@ self lab@@ ori@@ ously out of the water , his hea@@ vy cy@@ lin@@ ders ca@@ using him mom@@ en@@ tari@@ ly to lose balance , but a hea@@ ve from above lan@@ ded him safe and sound on the de@@ ck .
his dri@@ pping sha@@ pe was quickly sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by other members of the team who had been waiting on the di@@ ve plat@@ form .
Jack Ho@@ ward made his way down from the bri@@ dge wal@@ k@@ way and s@@ mi@@ led at his friend .
he still found it ama@@ zing that such a bul@@ ky figure could be so a@@ gile under@@ water .

this study is not based on bul@@ let@@ pro@@ of quanti@@ tative data , gu@@ ess@@ work or personal opinions , but on a combination of many things , including inter@@ views , general studies , general tr@@ ends and an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal evidence .
the gra@@ ph@@ s co@@ vering the period before 199@@ 0 are all based on inter@@ views and many G@@ oo@@ g@@ le sear@@ ches to lear@@ n about the history of ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers , T@@ V and radi@@ o — and more specifically , which methods of information ga@@ ther@@ ing people used in the past .
the gra@@ ph@@ s co@@ vering the period from 1998 and up to today are based on all the things that have happened in the past 11 years , concerning which I have probably seen 1000 surve@@ ys .
the gra@@ ph for 2009 and forward is based on what I , and many other people , pre@@ di@@ ct will happen in the years to come .
the gra@@ ph@@ s are not intended to be 100 % acc@@ u@@ rate , but rather to give an idea of the chan@@ ging land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , and to prepar@@ e for the future of social news , targe@@ ted information and the like .
the purpose of the article is to pus@@ h people forward .
we are see@@ ing an enti@@ rely new way for people to intera@@ ct ; one that makes all tradi@@ tional ways seem tri@@ vi@@ al .
it is a fundamental shi@@ ft that will completely change the world as we know it .
the best thing about it is that you will be able to help make it happen .
so jo@@ in me on this t@@ our of the last 2@@ 10 years of information sources plus a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se ten years ahead .
before we start to exp@@ l@@ ore the future , let &apos;s see how we reached the present . we &apos;ll be@@ gin by going back to 18@@ 00 — when fin@@ ding out information was very different .
in the 18@@ 00@@ s , the only way you could really intera@@ ct with other people was to go out and meet them .
it was all about fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face communication .
to sell a product , you would go to the local mark@@ et@@ place and , in general , the only way to intera@@ ct was to meet in person or to set up a sta@@ ll .
this me@@ ant for you to receive information — or to give it — you had to be at the right place at the right time .
you wouldn &apos;t know what was happ@@ ening in another part of the city , nor could you sell your products to people in other places .
there was some talk of a no@@ vel concep@@ t called a ne@@ w@@ s@@ paper ...
by the year 19@@ 00 , ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers and maga@@ z@@ ines had re@@ volu@@ tion@@ ised how we communic@@ ated , allow@@ ing us to get news from places where we had never been .
we could communic@@ ate our ide@@ as to people we had never seen and sell our products to others far away .
you still had to go out to talk other people , but you could stay on top of things without leaving your own city .
it was ama@@ zing ; the first real information re@@ volu@@ tion .
the world was opening up to everyone .
from the 19@@ 20@@ s on a new source of information ca@@ ught people &apos;s attention — the radi@@ o .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly you could listen to another person &apos;s voice hun@@ dre@@ ds of mi@@ les away .
but most import@@ antly , you could get the latest information live .
it was another tre@@ mend@@ ous e@@ volu@@ tion@@ ary step in the history of information .
however , radi@@ o &apos;s development time me@@ ant that ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers still domin@@ ated our lives in the years p@@ rece@@ ding the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s .
if you wanted to get the latest news , or to tell people about your product , you would turn to the ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers .
it see@@ med as if they would sure@@ ly be the domin@@ ant source of information for ever more .
this situation be@@ gan to change in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s .
radi@@ o had ca@@ ught on , and the two domin@@ ant sources of information were live news from the radi@@ o and the more detailed news via ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers and maga@@ z@@ ines .
it was a great time for the media , although some said that “ the way for ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers to meet the competition of radi@@ o is simp@@ ly to produce better pa@@ pers ” , an argu@@ ment that we would hear re@@ pea@@ te@@ dly for the next 50 years .
during the next 40 years the next technical re@@ volu@@ tion , te@@ lev@@ ision , was introduced .
it be@@ gan to ga@@ in public interest in the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , and by the early 199@@ 0@@ s its presence was hu@@ ge , effectively sur@@ pas@@ sing ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers and maga@@ z@@ ines wh@@ il@@ st domin@@ ating the radi@@ o .
now people could both hear and see information .
the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s – 199@@ 0@@ s was also the time when ne@@ w@@ s@@ paper execu@@ tives re@@ alised that something was going ter@@ ri@@ bly wrong with their market .
they had had many problems in compe@@ ting with radi@@ o , but te@@ lev@@ ision was in a different lea@@ gue again .
only eight years later and te@@ lev@@ ision ru@@ led the information world , radi@@ o had been almost reduced to “ a place where you can listen to free mus@@ ic ” , and ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers were doing everything they could to stay relevant .
the con@@ st@@ ant e@@ volu@@ tion of technology pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed ahead with ne@@ ver@@ -@@ be@@ fore@@ seen determin@@ ation .
a new ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on loo@@ med in the sha@@ do@@ ws : the inter@@ net .
1998 was the year when the inter@@ net changed from being a ge@@ ek@@ y place that had little relevance to being argu@@ ably essential , with an “ every company needs to have a website ” ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y .
the re@@ volu@@ tion had started three years earlier , but in 1998 it reached cri@@ tical mass and ca@@ ught everyone &apos;s attention , even if it was rela@@ tively little used and most people did not have access to it .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future ; the da@@ wn of a new era .
it was a place where anyone could get information from any@@ where — at least in the@@ ory .
people also started to re@@ alise that the inter@@ net was more than just information .
you could give something back by jo@@ ining the conver@@ sa@@ tion and being a part of the experience instead of just a spe@@ c@@ ta@@ tor .
most import@@ antly , you could choo@@ se what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it .
the pos@@ sibilities of the inter@@ net were min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling .
in 2004 , only six years later , and the inter@@ net had re@@ volu@@ tion@@ ised how we appro@@ ach@@ ed information .
te@@ lev@@ ision and ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers still domin@@ ated our news sources , but the new world was defin@@ ite@@ ly online .
people were making new web@@ sites and exp@@ l@@ oring the world of we@@ b applications .
people could do such an inc@@ redi@@ ble amount and participate in so many areas that a new concep@@ t appea@@ red : information over@@ load .
for the first time in our lives we were being ex@@ posed to more information than we could consu@@ me .
in the age of ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers we had to choo@@ se what we wanted to see .
in 2004 we had to choo@@ se what we didn &apos;t want to see .
this had a de@@ vasta@@ ting effect on the tradi@@ tional forms of information .
in the past you could get people &apos;s attention simp@@ ly by making something .
people wanted more choice , so you simp@@ ly had to give them another option .
in 2004 this changed , as it was not enough to make something different ; it had to be better .
2004 was also year when another new ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on started to take off : social net@@ working .
the concep@@ t had been s@@ low@@ ly ga@@ ining ground with the concep@@ t of blo@@ gs .
they were an easy , simple and af@@ for@@ da@@ ble way for everyone to share their ide@@ as .
for the first time , anyone could create their own sp@@ here of information without doing anything “ technical ” .
hand@@ ling information changed from being a too@@ l for the professi@@ on@@ als to a too@@ l for anyone .
three years later and the social element of the inter@@ net sho@@ wed just how pow@@ er@@ ful the voice of the people really is .
for the first time te@@ lev@@ ision was no longer the primary source of information , and ne@@ w@@ s-@@ pa@@ pers were stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling to survi@@ ve .
everyone wanted to create their own little world , and conne@@ ct it to their friends .
2007 was also the tur@@ ning point for tradi@@ tional web@@ sites , with people compar@@ ing them to ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers — a sta@@ tic and pas@@ sive form of information .
we wanted active information .
we wanted to be a part of it , not just to look at it .
blo@@ gs started to get into trouble .
just as te@@ lev@@ ision had elimin@@ ated radi@@ o ( because it was a better and ri@@ cher way to give people live information ) , so were social networks elimin@@ ating blo@@ gs .
a social profi@@ le is a more active way for people to share what they care about .
social networks are simp@@ ly the best too@@ l for the job , and blo@@ gs could not keep up .
two years later , today , the new inter@@ net d@@ om@@ ina@@ tes our world completely .
ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers are dead in the water , and people are wat@@ ching less te@@ lev@@ ision than ever .
we are the new k@@ ings of information , using social net@@ working tools to conne@@ ct and communic@@ ate .
even the tradi@@ tional website is d@@ ying , killed by the re@@ len@@ tle@@ ss force of con@@ st@@ ant st@@ rea@@ ming information from social networks .
in the past 2@@ 10 years we have seen an ama@@ zing e@@ volu@@ tion in how we ob@@ tain information .
the princip@@ al forward steps are :
1 . getting information from dist@@ ant places .
2 . getting it live .
3 . see@@ ing it live .
4 . deci@@ ding when to see something , and what to see .
5 . being able to take part and com@@ ment .
6 . publish@@ ing our own information .
7 . being the source of information .
2009 will be the start of the next re@@ volu@@ tion .
everything we know is about to change .
the first and most dra@@ matic change is the concep@@ t of social news .
this is quickly taking over our need to stay up to date with what goes on in the world .
news is no longer being reported by jour@@ nal@@ is@@ ts , as now it comes from anyone and everyone .
it is being reported directly from the source to you — b@@ y@@ pas@@ sing the tradi@@ tional media chan@@ nel@@ s .
instead of having a jour@@ nal@@ ist report what analy@@ s@@ ts are saying , you hear it from the analy@@ st her@@ self .
social news is getting news from the source , directly and un@@ fil@@ tered .
a new wa@@ ve of enter@@ tain@@ ment is emer@@ ging ( the light blu@@ e and pur@@ ple areas on the gra@@ ph ) , one domin@@ ated by the ga@@ mes , vide@@ o and audi@@ o st@@ rea@@ ms .
instead of tu@@ ning into a te@@ lev@@ ision chan@@ nel , you decide what to see and when to see it .
we no longer sub@@ scri@@ be to chan@@ nel@@ s where someone else deci@@ des what you can see .
you control everything about the experience .
a new concep@@ t in the form of targe@@ ted information is s@@ low@@ ly emer@@ ging .
we are already see@@ ing an increasing number of services on mo@@ bile ph@@ ones that provide local information for the area that you are in .
for example , instead of sho@@ wing all the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants in the world , the phone will only show a list of those in your area .
this is something that will explo@@ de in the years to come .
in a world where we have access to more information that we can consu@@ me , getting the relevant information is going to be a very important element , exp@@ and@@ ing far beyond the simple ge@@ o-@@ tar@@ get@@ ing that we see today .
over the next five to ten years , the world of information will change .
all the tradi@@ tional forms will ess@@ enti@@ ally die .
prin@@ ted ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ pers will no longer exist , te@@ lev@@ ision in the form of pre@@ set chan@@ nel@@ s will be replaced by single shows that you can watch wh@@ ene@@ ver you like .
radi@@ o shows are dest@@ ined to be replaced with po@@ d@@ cas@@ ts and vo@@ d@@ cas@@ ts .
web@@ sites will have a much s@@ mal@@ ler role , as their primary function will be to serve as a hu@@ b for all the activities that you do el@@ se@@ where , be@@ coming the place where people get the raw material for use in other places .
many web@@ sites and social networks will mer@@ ge into one .
social news , as described previ@@ ously , is going to be the main way that people communic@@ ate .
tradi@@ tional jour@@ nal@@ ism will be completely super@@ se@@ ded as people get information directly from the source .
everyone is a potential repor@@ ter , but new advan@@ ces in tar@@ get@@ ing will elimin@@ ate most of the no@@ ise .
jour@@ nal@@ is@@ ts will become ed@@ itors who , instead of reporting the news , will bring it together to give us a big@@ ger pic@@ ture .
the news st@@ ream of the future will be person@@ alised , and will con@@ st@@ antly at just what you see — much in the same way as L@@ ast@@ .@@ f@@ m is doing today with mus@@ ic .
everything will incorpo@@ rate some form of tar@@ get@@ ing .
you will be in control over every single bit of information that flow@@ s your way .
in 2010 , two new concep@@ ts will start to emer@@ ge .
one of them is inte@@ lli@@ gent information , where information st@@ rea@@ ms can comb@@ ine pi@@ ec@@ es from many different news sources , not just by pul@@ ling data , but by sum@@ mar@@ ising it , brea@@ king it a@@ part and extra@@ cting the valu@@ able parts .
instead of reading five different artic@@ les on the same top@@ ic , you will be presented with one , high@@ ligh@@ ting the vi@@ tal points of interest .
how safe are your Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts ?
EU testing shows serious risk of sho@@ cks and fire in many li@@ ghts .
stay safe – turn them off when you go to bed or leave the house .
one in three sets of Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts tested in a com@@ missi@@ on-@@ led market surve@@ y presented a direct risk of fire or electri@@ c sho@@ ck .
tests were carried out in Germany , Hung@@ ary , the Netherlands , Sloven@@ ia and Slova@@ kia on ne@@ arly 200 sets of light st@@ r@@ ings in all price categories .
the samp@@ les were che@@ cked against over 20 requirements , and many fa@@ iled more than one test .
the com@@ mission found th@@ in w@@ ir@@ ing , we@@ ak cor@@ d an@@ ch@@ or@@ age and poor insu@@ lation in many st@@ r@@ ings of li@@ ghts .
just over 40 % of the samp@@ les were made in China .
in Hung@@ ary , ne@@ arly 96 % of the li@@ ghts were found to be haz@@ ar@@ d@@ ous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % fa@@ iled to comply with EU safety standards .
although only five countries took part in the surve@@ y , it is likely the same li@@ ghts are being s@@ old across the EU .
consumer com@@ mission@@ er Me@@ g@@ len@@ a K@@ une@@ va said the fin@@ dings were a wa@@ ke@@ -up call .
she ur@@ ged EU member countries to do a better job of enfor@@ cing safety standards and said industry – manufacture@@ rs , re@@ ta@@ i@@ lers , distribu@@ tors and impor@@ ters – should also step up their checks .
as for consumers , she stres@@ sed vig@@ il@@ ance , off@@ ering the following advice : 1. buy Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts from re@@ pu@@ table deal@@ ers 2. never leave Chris@@ t@@ mas li@@ ghts on when you are out of the house or in bed 3. if you sus@@ pe@@ ct a problem with your li@@ ghts , stop using them and return them to the sho@@ p .
some 4@@ ,000 partici@@ pants from 1,@@ 500 organisations are expected to atten@@ d a S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m event sho@@ w@@ cas@@ ing EU efforts to boo@@ st development .
under the over@@ ar@@ ching the@@ me of ‘ citizens and development ’ , this year &apos;s event will focus on the effects of global w@@ arm@@ ing and the rec@@ ession on po@@ ore@@ r countries .
although they are usually least to bla@@ me , these countries are particularly hard hit by both the economic down@@ turn and climate change .
ris@@ ing sea levels , de@@ serti@@ fication and more frequ@@ ent and severe natural dis@@ as@@ ters could pus@@ h mil@@ li@@ ons into poverty and un@@ do past progress on the mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um development go@@ als .
and the current economic climate has lead to a reduction in aid don@@ ations to developing countries , reducing food security in already vulner@@ able regions .
by br@@ inging together poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans , civil ser@@ van@@ ts , NG@@ O@@ s , business le@@ ad@@ ers , ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ cs , re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers and the media , the European Development Da@@ ys provide an opportunity for net@@ working , sh@@ aring experi@@ ences and fin@@ ding new partners for development projects .
the th@@ ree@@ -@@ day event , starting on 22 October , includes training , discussion for@@ u@@ ms and work@@ sh@@ op@@ s .
a development ‘ vil@@ la@@ ge ’ gives organisations the chance to present themselves to dele@@ ga@@ tes and the public , and to raise awareness of their aims .
several develop@@ men@@ t-@@ related pri@@ z@@ es will be a@@ warded , including the L@@ or@@ en@@ z@@ o Na@@ ta@@ li jour@@ nal@@ ism pri@@ ze for exc@@ ell@@ ence in reporting on human rights , democracy and development issues .
the development y@@ outh pri@@ ze goes to teen@@ ag@@ ers for pos@@ ters or vide@@ os sho@@ wing human development in Africa .
on 22 October , the EU will also pub@@ lish the fir@@ st@@ -@@ ever European development report .
it will form a basis for discus@@ sions on the EU &apos;s approach to ‘ fra@@ gile ’ countries in sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa .
the EU provides more than half of all development aid .
don@@ or con@@ ference s@@ ends strong sig@@ nal of support for Geor@@ gia .
until recently Geor@@ gia had one of the world &apos;s f@@ as@@ te@@ st@@ -@@ growing econom@@ ies – 12 % growth in 2007 .
that changed during the bri@@ ef but inten@@ se conflict with Russia in August .
key transport rou@@ tes and u@@ ti@@ lity lines were dama@@ ged , buil@@ dings and ho@@ uses reduced to rub@@ ble and hu@@ ge s@@ wa@@ th@@ es of fo@@ rest destro@@ yed by b@@ om@@ b@@ s .
more than two months later , many foreign inves@@ tors have taken f@@ light , tour@@ is@@ ts have dis@@ appea@@ red , un@@ employment has ris@@ en and many Geor@@ gi@@ ans have emp@@ ti@@ ed their bank accounts .
the World Bank now estima@@ tes that Geor@@ gia , a ga@@ te@@ way for energy resources to Europe , needs € 2.@@ 4@@ b@@ n to rec@@ over .
the EU has committed € 5@@ 00@@ m over the next three years and the US has ple@@ dged € 7@@ 5@@ 7@@ m ( $ 1@@ b@@ n ) , more than half of it by the end of this year .
the EU and the World Bank ho@@ s@@ ted a don@@ or con@@ ference on 22 October , to bring in the remain@@ ing € 1.@@ 1@@ b@@ n@@ .
ne@@ arly 70 countries and institutions were invi@@ ted to the event .
the aid will support re@@ construction and help the Geor@@ gi@@ an government meet the immedi@@ ate needs of people who had to fle@@ e their ho@@ mes .
ten@@ s of tho@@ us@@ ands of people were u@@ proo@@ ted , many of wh@@ om are still sh@@ el@@ tering in ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cen@@ t@@ res .
but the long-term objective is to re@@ vi@@ ve Geor@@ gia &apos;s economy , which has under@@ gone consider@@ able reform in recent years .
“ It is essential that the crisis should not dis@@ tra@@ ct Geor@@ gia from the political and economic reform efforts that are , if anything , more important now than before this sum@@ mer &apos;s conflict , ” external relations com@@ mission@@ er Ben@@ ita Fer@@ re@@ ro@@ -@@ Wal@@ d@@ ner said .

Geor@@ gia and Russia remain at o@@ d@@ ds over S@@ outh O@@ s@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ haz@@ ia , two brea@@ ka@@ way Geor@@ gi@@ an prov@@ inc@@ es that Russia recogn@@ ises as independent countries .
the two sides held a first ro@@ und of peace tal@@ ks in G@@ ene@@ va on 15 October , and negotiations are to re@@ su@@ me in November under the aus@@ pic@@ es of UN and European medi@@ ators .
this allowed EU obser@@ vers to move into those z@@ ones to monitor the ce@@ ase@@ fire .

“ We &apos;re very sure it will help the band in the future . ”
2008 C@@ ann@@ es f@@ esti@@ val shows ever@@ -@@ growing success of EU-@@ fun@@ ded fil@@ ms wor@@ ld@@ wide .
f@@ our@@ teen fil@@ ms jo@@ in@@ tly fun@@ ded by the EU media programme have been sele@@ cted to appear at the 6@@ 1@@ st C@@ ann@@ es international fil@@ m f@@ esti@@ val .
EU-@@ fun@@ ded produc@@ tions are no st@@ ran@@ gers to fil@@ m f@@ esti@@ val@@ s and over the years have been seen by mil@@ li@@ ons of people .
the EU media programme funds European audiovisu@@ al projects , promoting the contin@@ ent &apos;s cultural diversity through fil@@ m .
however , European fil@@ m mak@@ ers face major challenges both inter@@ nation@@ ally and at home .
on 19 May , during the si@@ x@@ th “ Europe day ” at C@@ ann@@ es , EU representatives will sit down with European fil@@ m minis@@ ters and producers to discus@@ s how to stimu@@ late more international cooperation in the audiovisu@@ al industry .
the aim is to exp@@ and the circu@@ lation of content to other parts of the world and work more closely with fil@@ m indus@@ tries outside the EU .
such international partner@@ ships would further aid the production and distribution of European fil@@ ms .
last year &apos;s selection for the C@@ ann@@ es f@@ esti@@ val included ele@@ ven fil@@ ms fun@@ ded by the EU media programme .
and earlier this year a st@@ ring of EU-@@ bac@@ ked fil@@ ms - such as The counter@@ fe@@ i@@ ters and L@@ a M@@ ô@@ me – were gar@@ lan@@ ded at the O@@ sc@@ ars .
the 14 EU-@@ fun@@ ded fil@@ ms at C@@ ann@@ es 2008 are : G@@ om@@ or@@ ra , D@@ el@@ ta , L@@ a fron@@ ti@@ è@@ re de l &apos;@@ Au@@ be , L@@ e sil@@ ence de L@@ or@@ na , The Pal@@ er@@ m@@ o S@@ hoo@@ ting , san@@ gue pa@@ zz@@ o , En@@ tre les mur@@ s , T@@ ul@@ p@@ an , El@@ dor@@ ad@@ o , El@@ è@@ ve li@@ b@@ re , Sal@@ am@@ and@@ ra , L@@ es bu@@ re@@ au@@ x de Di@@ e@@ u , B@@ et@@ ter things and H@@ ome .
climate change , the financial crisis and economic relations domin@@ ated the EU-@@ China sum@@ mit in P@@ ra@@ gue on 20 May .
the EU and China signed agreements to exp@@ and cooperation in sci@@ ence and technology , clean energy and small business .
and they rea@@ ff@@ ir@@ med their commitment to a project to sho@@ w@@ case technology for gener@@ ating electricity from co@@ al without re@@ le@@ as@@ ing CO2 - one of the main ga@@ ses behind global w@@ arm@@ ing .
the two sides also explo@@ red positions ahead of the international tal@@ ks on climate change in C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen in December .
the EU is ur@@ ging emer@@ ging econom@@ ies like China to limit CO2 emissions in exchange for financial support from developed na@@ tions .
on the financial crisis , the EU and China agree that international institutions should have a big@@ ger role in monitoring economic risks and that the emer@@ ging and developing econom@@ ies should have more say in these institutions .
at high-@@ level tal@@ ks earlier in May , the two sides emphas@@ ised trade and investment as key to economic recovery .
the two sides also discussed human rights in Ti@@ bet and confli@@ cts in S@@ ri Lan@@ ka , Af@@ g@@ han@@ istan and Pak@@ istan – three countries where China wi@@ elds consider@@ able influ@@ ence .

the Minister for Agriculture of L@@ at@@ via J@@ ā@@ n@@ is D@@ ū@@ kla@@ v@@ s informed about the four countries &apos; Me@@ mor@@ an@@ du@@ m that was signed today and provides for more fa@@ vor@@ able conditions for cooperation in agriculture between the countries .
it will be based on equality and mutual benefit , by al@@ ig@@ ning the legislation and through the exchange of information and practical projects .
the Pri@@ me Minister emp@@ h@@ asi@@ zed : “ The Me@@ mor@@ an@@ du@@ m that was signed today will promote the cooperation in a very substantial sector of national economy for all four countries - agriculture ” .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food of Bel@@ ar@@ us Se@@ my@@ on S@@ hap@@ ir@@ o th@@ an@@ ked the Minister for Agriculture of L@@ at@@ via J@@ ā@@ n@@ is D@@ ū@@ kla@@ v@@ s for the initiative , which was expressed during his vis@@ it to Min@@ s@@ k , to bring together the Minis@@ ters for Agriculture of three Bal@@ tic countries and Bel@@ ar@@ us not only to discus@@ s the issues and current events of the sector , but also to out@@ line certain tasks to be performed in the future .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food of Bel@@ ar@@ us noted that Bel@@ ar@@ us has the practical experience in production of full range of agricultural mach@@ in@@ ery and it would be interested in creating joint enterprises with L@@ at@@ via .
Minister S@@ hap@@ ir@@ o called on to help the professi@@ on@@ als in agriculture of L@@ at@@ via and other Bal@@ tic countries , to provide practical experience in the area of certi@@ fication of agricultural product processing companies and companies produc@@ ing agricultural mach@@ in@@ ery in order to ensure sales opportunities for agricultural products of Bel@@ ar@@ us in the EU market .
the Minister for Agriculture of Li@@ th@@ u@@ ania Ka@@ z@@ ys Sta@@ r@@ ke@@ vi@@ č@@ i@@ us expressed his gra@@ ti@@ tude for active mutual cooperation in agriculture and fisheries in the European Union in Brussels among the three Bal@@ tic countries , Fin@@ land and Poland , but today a new model of cooperation among the three Bal@@ tic countries and Bel@@ ar@@ us was acti@@ va@@ ted .
the Minister for Agriculture of Est@@ onia He@@ li@@ r – Val@@ d@@ or Se@@ e@@ der stres@@ sed that currently there is an active cooperation with L@@ at@@ via in the area of agriculture , which has a ten@@ d@@ ency to increase .
the minister also informed that there are three main priorities in the next year &apos;s budget of Est@@ onia , one of them being agriculture .
on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , December 9 , in B@@ on@@ n , Pri@@ me Minister Val@@ dis D@@ om@@ bro@@ v@@ sk@@ is received the s@@ me Union Poli@@ tical En@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship A@@ ward of the European Pe@@ ople &apos;s Party for promotion of en@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship policy .
the a@@ ward was han@@ ded over by the President of the s@@ me Union Peter jun@@ gen , who emp@@ h@@ asi@@ zed that the main objective of the a@@ ward is to sha@@ pe the EU policy in a more s@@ me fri@@ end@@ ly way .
the Pri@@ me Minister of L@@ at@@ via th@@ an@@ ked the s@@ me Union for ap@@ preci@@ ation and contribution to the development of inves@@ t@@ men@@ t-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly and efficient business environment in Europe .
V@@ .@@ D@@ om@@ bro@@ v@@ sk@@ is stres@@ sed that the s@@ me Union network has contribu@@ ted to the idea on implementation of support measures for micro@@ -@@ enterprises in L@@ at@@ via .
the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability , but has also developed a support pro@@ gra@@ m for micro@@ -@@ enterprises in L@@ at@@ via aimed at reducing barri@@ ers to micro@@ -@@ enter@@ prise activities and encoura@@ ging the people who are out of work to start their own business .
to achieve the objective , the Government has adopted a decision on the reduced requirements for company &apos;s share capital and the cost of registration , simpli@@ fied procedures for tax reporting and accounting , and has granted financial support for micro@@ -@@ enter@@ prise activities .
in his spe@@ ech , the Pri@@ me Minister stres@@ sed that small and medium-@@ size enterprises are the driving force for the economy , contribu@@ ting to reduction of un@@ employment , long-term development and stability .
we have already informed that from December 8@@ -@@ 10 Pri@@ me Minister Val@@ dis D@@ om@@ bro@@ v@@ sk@@ is participa@@ tes in the European Pe@@ ople &apos;s Party Con@@ g@@ ress in B@@ on@@ n , Germany .
the Re@@ form Management Group has agreed on a joint communication that will be signed already on Mon@@ day , November 2 . the communication presents the assessment of the current work of the group and out@@ lines the main tasks to be ac@@ com@@ p@@ lish@@ ed within the framework of structural reforms .
the communication recogni@@ z@@ es the cooperation model established by the government and non-@@ govern@@ mental organ@@ iz@@ ations , which re@@ presents the joint responsibility for the soci@@ o-@@ economic situation in the country , the international obligations of L@@ at@@ via and their impact on future developments .
the Re@@ form Management Group has assig@@ ned a priority to those tasks which directly focus on national competitiveness , growth and recovery of economy .
the Group emp@@ h@@ asi@@ z@@ es that by the joint assessment of the state fun@@ ctions to be performed and ra@@ tional use of potential state budget resources the progress has been made in determining the reduction of funds pursuant to the results of tas@@ k and function assessment a@@ im@@ ing to stop the l@@ ine@@ ar fund cu@@ tting .
although an agreement was reached on the objectives – small and efficient administration , ex@@ pan@@ sion of internal and external market for the economy of L@@ at@@ via and promotion of the employment , the members of the group share the common opinion on the need to continue the work on defin@@ ing a clear framework for future structural reforms .
the Re@@ form Management Group believes that it is necessary to continue to acti@@ vely implement the social security measures , the measures included in the economic recovery plan aimed at en@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship promotion and investment attra@@ ction , the measures in support to micro@@ -@@ enter@@ prise activities and business star@@ t-@@ ups , in-@@ dep@@ th examination of the public administration fun@@ ctions , st@@ rea@@ m@@ lin@@ ing the evaluation metho@@ dol@@ ogy and introduction of a on@@ e-@@ stop@@ -@@ sho@@ p principle in service provision .
the Re@@ form Management Group has agreed on the nec@@ essi@@ ty to speed up the implementation of the EU program@@ s which were de@@ la@@ yed in the current period and reach the five years &apos; amount in two years &apos; time . the Group also considers that the medium-@@ term budget should be implemented by di@@ vi@@ ding the budget into opera@@ tive and development budget lin@@ king the rest@@ or@@ ation of the internal market with future development priorities , attra@@ ctive investment climate for domestic and foreign capital , by reducing tax@@ es and introduc@@ ing other com@@ para@@ tive advan@@ tag@@ es .
the Re@@ form Management Group was established in July , 2009 with the aim to ensure the public participation in the budget draf@@ ting and decisi@@ on-@@ making .
on November 26 and 27 an international con@@ ference “ Un@@ registered partner@@ ships in the European Union ” was held in R@@ iga .
L@@ at@@ via and Est@@ onia agree on joint ren@@ ting of pre@@ mises for diplo@@ matic representa@@ tions in Ara@@ b Republic of E@@ gy@@ pt .
from 1 January 2010 on@@ wards , the representa@@ tions of L@@ at@@ via and Est@@ onia in the Ara@@ b Republic of E@@ gy@@ pt will work in jo@@ in@@ tly ren@@ ted facilities , thus opti@@ mis@@ ing their administrative costs .
the agreement to this effect was reached between Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins and the Foreign Minister of Est@@ onia U@@ r@@ mas Pa@@ et during his official vis@@ it to R@@ iga on 18 February this year , and fin@@ alised in the following consul@@ tations between the Foreign Minis@@ tries .
this initiative is a pri@@ me example for the Bal@@ tic states co-@@ operation in the implementation of similar projects also in future , in view of the cha@@ ir@@ man@@ ship of the Bal@@ tic Council of Minis@@ ters that L@@ at@@ via is to assu@@ me in 2010 .
the E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y of L@@ at@@ via in K@@ air@@ o has been operational since 2007 ; it was offici@@ ally opened in March 2009 during the vis@@ it to E@@ gy@@ pt by Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins .
from 2010 on@@ wards , the represen@@ tation of Est@@ onia in E@@ gy@@ pt will also start its work in pre@@ mises ren@@ ted jo@@ in@@ tly with L@@ at@@ via .
L@@ at@@ via is represented in the Ara@@ b Republic of E@@ gy@@ pt by A@@ mb@@ assa@@ d@@ or Mar@@ is Sel@@ ga .
foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins in te@@ lep@@ h@@ one conver@@ sa@@ tion with Rus@@ sian Foreign Minister invi@@ tes to seek spe@@ ed@@ y solution to car@@ go carri@@ ers &apos; situation on L@@ at@@ vi@@ a-@@ Russia border .
on 25 December a te@@ lep@@ h@@ one conver@@ sa@@ tion took place between Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins and the Foreign Minister of the Rus@@ sian Fed@@ eration , Ser@@ ge@@ y La@@ v@@ ro@@ v . both parties discussed the results of the relations between the countries in 2009 as well as current developments in the situation with car@@ go carri@@ ers on the L@@ at@@ vi@@ a-@@ Russia border .
both foreign minis@@ ters sha@@ red the opinion that , on the whole , the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs of bilateral relations this year was to be rated posi@@ tively .
next , the minis@@ ters re@@ vie@@ wed the agenda for L@@ at@@ vi@@ a-@@ Russia relations in the coming year , including further enhan@@ cement of the legal framework , i.e. several significant inter@@ govern@@ mental agreements have been prepared for sig@@ ning .
minis@@ ters R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins and La@@ v@@ ro@@ v discussed also the current situation concerning car@@ go carri@@ ers on the border of L@@ at@@ via and Russia .
due to the enhanced customs control by the Rus@@ sian Fed@@ eration the situation on the L@@ at@@ vi@@ a-@@ Russia border is dra@@ matic , and a spe@@ ed@@ y solution is required to elimin@@ ate the long lines of tru@@ cks on the L@@ at@@ vi@@ an side of the border cross@@ ing points , which is ca@@ using significant lo@@ s@@ ses , Foreign Minister R@@ ie@@ k@@ st@@ ins noted in the te@@ lep@@ h@@ one conver@@ sa@@ tion .
the minis@@ ters agreed that the relevant institutions of both countries , including L@@ at@@ via &apos;s Ro@@ ad Transport Associ@@ ation L@@ at@@ vi@@ jas Au@@ to , should continue their efforts to nor@@ mal@@ ise the situation in the ne@@ are@@ st future according to the agreement achieved on 18 December during the Inter@@ govern@@ mental Commission &apos;s Transport Wor@@ king Group .

I have recently or@@ dered a new pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ( item # 6@@ 5@@ 4@@ 29@@ 51 ) from your website on June 21 .
I received the order on June 26 .
un@@ fortu@@ na@@ tely , when I opened it I saw that the sho@@ es were used .
the sho@@ es had di@@ r@@ t all over it and there was a small tea@@ r in front of the part where the left to@@ e would go .
my order number is AF@@ 2@@ 6@@ 16@@ 8@@ 15@@ 6 .
to res@@ ol@@ ve the problem , I would like you to credit my account for the amount char@@ ged for my sho@@ es .
I have already went out and b@@ ought a new pa@@ ir of sho@@ es at my local spor@@ ting goods store so s@@ ending another would result in me having two pa@@ irs of the same sho@@ es .

my name is S@@ us@@ an Har@@ ris and I am writing on behalf of the stu@@ dents at Lo@@ ck@@ w@@ ood M@@ id@@ dle Sch@@ ool .
we would like to invi@@ te you to atten@@ d a special event being held at our school .
we would be hon@@ ored by your atten@@ dance .
please re@@ ply by Mon@@ day the 2@@ 6@@ th of February to confir@@ m your atten@@ dance .
we look forward to see@@ ing you there ,

in 2007 , the most pow@@ er@@ ful partic@@ le ac@@ cele@@ ra@@ tor ever buil@@ t , C@@ ER@@ N &apos;s new L@@ ar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ r@@ on Col@@ li@@ der , will pro@@ be the secre@@ ts of matter in the energy states pre@@ va@@ iling in the mom@@ ents after the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
by col@@ li@@ ding partic@@ les together when they are moving at close to the speed of light , physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts hope to find out about matter in its ear@@ li@@ est forms , using the energy produced by the col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons .
what is expected from the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous investment made by Europe in the production of the L@@ H@@ C ?
it will thro@@ w two be@@ a@@ ms of pro@@ t@@ ons , partic@@ les form@@ ing part of the at@@ om@@ ic nu@@ cle@@ us and bel@@ on@@ ging to the ha@@ d@@ r@@ on family , in op@@ posi@@ te direc@@ tions ro@@ und a circu@@ lar under@@ ground tunne@@ l of 27 km circu@@ m@@ ference bene@@ ath S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land and France .
inten@@ sive mag@@ ne@@ tic fields are required to ac@@ cele@@ rate the pro@@ t@@ ons and make sure they are en@@ closed in nar@@ row be@@ a@@ ms . these fields will be produced by super@@ conduc@@ tors , materials that are able to conduct electricity with neither res@@ ist@@ ance nor energy loss and which function at very low tempera@@ tures , developed in col@@ labor@@ ation with European industry .
col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons between pro@@ t@@ ons occu@@ r at a rate of eight hun@@ d@@ red million times per second at a col@@ os@@ sal energy of 14 Te@@ V .
to understand the mag@@ ni@@ tude of this number , 1 Te@@ V is the approxima@@ te amount of energy used for motion … by a mo@@ squ@@ i@@ to in f@@ light .
in the L@@ H@@ C , however , this energy will be concentra@@ ted in an area one million million times s@@ mal@@ ler than the in@@ sec@@ t .
since the energy can be conver@@ ted to partic@@ les in accordance with the principle of mass / energy equival@@ ence in restric@@ ted rela@@ tivity – the fa@@ m@@ ous E = m@@ c@@ 2 – physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts hope to create partic@@ les that have never before been observed in ac@@ cele@@ ra@@ tors .
the den@@ si@@ ty and intensi@@ ty of the col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons are important , as they multi@@ ply the chan@@ ces of see@@ ing the appe@@ arance of the partic@@ les .
two be@@ a@@ ms of lead nu@@ cle@@ i will also be produced , reach@@ ing energi@@ es of 1 150 Te@@ V@@ s , but with fe@@ wer col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons per second .
from the search for super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try …
certain dete@@ ctors will be cap@@ able of col@@ lis@@ i@@ on analysis .
two of them are called C@@ MS ( Com@@ pac@@ t Mu@@ on sol@@ en@@ o@@ id ) and At@@ las ( A To@@ ro@@ ida@@ l L@@ H@@ C Ap@@ para@@ tus ) .
they will concentra@@ te on the de@@ tection of super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c partic@@ les and H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ ons .
what about super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
partic@@ le physi@@ cs consis@@ ts of nu@@ mer@@ ous sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries – for example , matter and anti@@ matter .
super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try associ@@ ates a fer@@ mi@@ on ( building blo@@ cks of matter like elec@@ tr@@ ons and quar@@ ks ) to each Bos@@ on ( direc@@ ting transmission of intera@@ ctions like the ph@@ ot@@ on ) and vice ver@@ sa .
the challenge is that the anti@@ partic@@ les ter@@ med super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c ( also designa@@ ted s@@ partic@@ les ) have never before been observed .
how to dete@@ ct them ?
par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , by their absence !
“ It &apos;s a little like being at the c@@ ine@@ ma .
you coun@@ t the number and type of people who enter and those that leave .
if a person is mis@@ sing at the end , then because you know who entered you can make a guess at who did not ex@@ it . ”
in the same way , L@@ H@@ C tes@@ ters know that certain col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons are supposed to produce these s@@ partic@@ les , which are in@@ visi@@ ble to all dete@@ ctors .
know@@ ing the energi@@ es of the partic@@ les prior to col@@ lis@@ i@@ on , they will be compared to the energi@@ es of the partic@@ les produced after the col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons .
if there is any difference in energy , then a partic@@ le has es@@ cap@@ ed .
by calcu@@ lating the mis@@ sing energy , they will know if a super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c component or s@@ partic@@ le is involved .
the other challenge for the C@@ MS and L@@ H@@ S dete@@ ctors is to dete@@ ct the H@@ ig@@ gs Bos@@ on .
the fo@@ cal point of the standard model the@@ ory , this is supposed to intera@@ ct with the partic@@ les and give them mass .
how ?
let &apos;s consider a room full of physi@@ cs stu@@ dents .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , Al@@ bert E@@ inste@@ in en@@ ters the room and the stu@@ dents sur@@ ro@@ und him and press him with their questions .
Al@@ bert , then , in his at@@ temp@@ ts to move , feel@@ s a certain in@@ er@@ tia due to the stu@@ dents that are c@@ l@@ inging to him .
he is similar to these partic@@ les when H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ ons try to intera@@ ct with them – they ga@@ in mass .
here too , the much anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted de@@ tection of these fa@@ m@@ ous b@@ os@@ ons can only be indirec@@ t : the partic@@ les that result from their dis@@ integration are the ones that will be dete@@ cted .
the quar@@ k-@@ g@@ lu@@ on sou@@ p
the third dete@@ ctor with which the L@@ H@@ C is equi@@ pped is na@@ med A@@ li@@ ce ( A L@@ ar@@ ge I@@ on Col@@ li@@ der Ex@@ peri@@ ment ) .
its purpose is to exp@@ l@@ ore the un@@ known sec@@ tions of nuclear physi@@ cs , especially a state of matter that exis@@ ted a very short time after the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g known as quar@@ k-@@ g@@ lu@@ on plasma .
what is this new o@@ d@@ d@@ ity ?
in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s , sci@@ en@@ tis@@ ts re@@ alised that the pro@@ t@@ ons and neu@@ tr@@ ons that make up the nu@@ cle@@ us of at@@ oms , were themselves made up of more basic partic@@ les , quar@@ ks .
these quar@@ ks are linked to each other by strong for@@ ces , themselves direc@@ ted by partic@@ les known as G@@ lu@@ ons .
one of their characteristics is that they are g@@ reg@@ ari@@ ous : they always go in pa@@ irs or in thre@@ es ; they cannot exist by themselves .
the more you try to separate a quar@@ k from another quar@@ k , the greater the co@@ he@@ sive force that bin@@ ds them together , making them perman@@ ently in@@ separ@@ able .
quar@@ ks are said to be con@@ fin@@ ed .
however , if pro@@ t@@ ons are b@@ om@@ bar@@ ded against each other at high energi@@ es , a sou@@ p is created containing quar@@ ks and G@@ lu@@ ons in which the quar@@ ks will be free to move .
we can then ref@@ er to the de@@ con@@ fin@@ ing of the quar@@ ks in the quar@@ k-@@ g@@ lu@@ on plasma .
why this de@@ con@@ fin@@ ing ?
“ It is a little compar@@ able to s@@ ki@@ ing .
when there isn &apos;t much s@@ now , the tra@@ cks can be separ@@ ated by g@@ ras@@ sy z@@ ones and the s@@ ki@@ ers are con@@ fin@@ ed on their tra@@ cks .
on the other hand , if there is a lot of s@@ now , they can change tra@@ cks .
they are de@@ con@@ fin@@ ed . ”
rather than s@@ now , physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts will ad@@ d energy : the greater the quar@@ k energy , the we@@ ak@@ er their co@@ he@@ sive for@@ ces , so above a certain energy thre@@ sh@@ old , they can be separ@@ ated .
this quar@@ k-@@ g@@ lu@@ on plasma state was probably the state of matter a few micro@@ secon@@ ds after the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
that is why physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts wish to study it with the help of le@@ ad@@ -@@ i@@ on be@@ a@@ ms produced by the L@@ H@@ C .
these are , in effect , very ri@@ ch in pro@@ t@@ ons and neu@@ tr@@ ons .
they can at@@ tain an energy of 1,@@ 150 Te@@ V which is required to produce and study the quar@@ k-@@ g@@ lu@@ on plasma present at the beginning of the uni@@ verse with un@@ prec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted prec@@ ision .
the my@@ s@@ ter@@ y of anti@@ matter
finally , the last dete@@ ctor , na@@ med L@@ H@@ C@@ b , the L@@ ar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ r@@ on Col@@ li@@ der beau@@ ty .
its go@@ al is to better obser@@ ve the sub@@ tle differences between matter and anti@@ matter in order to better understand what happened to the Uni@@ verse &apos;s anti@@ matter .
for each partic@@ le , there is an anti@@ partic@@ le that has , among other proper@@ ties , the same mass but an op@@ posi@@ te char@@ ge@@ . the same mass but an op@@ posi@@ te charge .
therefore , for the nega@@ tively char@@ ged elec@@ tr@@ on , there is a corresponding anti@@ elec@@ tr@@ on ( or posi@@ tr@@ on ) of equal mass but with a positive charge .
when an elec@@ tr@@ on and an anti@@ elec@@ tr@@ on meet , they an@@ ni@@ hi@@ late each other , produc@@ ing a bur@@ st of energy .
according to the standard model of partic@@ le physi@@ cs , equal amounts of matter and anti@@ matter must have been created at the beginning of the uni@@ verse .
consequ@@ ently , all partic@@ les should have can@@ cel@@ led each other out and the uni@@ verse should be emp@@ ty .
however , as anyone can see , matter is ab@@ und@@ ant .
this is where the question ar@@ ises that the L@@ H@@ C@@ b will at@@ temp@@ t to answer : where , then , is anti@@ matter ?
one possible answer is based on the ability of certain partic@@ les to trans@@ form themselves into their anti@@ partic@@ les and vice ver@@ sa .
in this case , the existence of matter depend@@ s on the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis – yet to be pro@@ ven – that the trans@@ formation of anti@@ partic@@ les into partic@@ les is depend@@ ent upon the op@@ posi@@ te trans@@ formation at the beginning of the uni@@ verse .
can such dis@@ equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um be demonstra@@ ted ?
it has actually been seen experi@@ men@@ tally with quar@@ k-@@ type partic@@ les called ka@@ ons .
An@@ tika@@ ons s@@ pon@@ tane@@ ously trans@@ form into ka@@ ons but the op@@ posi@@ te occur@@ s less often .
the L@@ H@@ C@@ b will study another can@@ didate , mes@@ on B , which contains ( among other things ) , an ele@@ mentary partic@@ le ( or its anti@@ partic@@ le ) called quar@@ k b , or beau@@ ty ( from wh@@ ence the char@@ ming name of the L@@ CH@@ b ) .
though partic@@ les cannot be seen , it is possible to dete@@ ct them .
to do this , the L@@ H@@ C is equi@@ pped with de@@ vices consis@@ ting of several con@@ cen@@ tri@@ c la@@ yers which , like an oni@@ on , sur@@ ro@@ und the partic@@ le be@@ am where the col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons occu@@ r .
each la@@ yer speci@@ al@@ ises in one particular type of de@@ tection .
at the cen@@ tre of the dete@@ ctor , there is a tra@@ ck cha@@ mber . inside this cha@@ mber , there are mil@@ li@@ ons of se@@ mi@@ conduc@@ tors that produce an electri@@ c pul@@ se when tou@@ ched by a partic@@ le .
these pul@@ ses are recor@@ ded by compu@@ ters . this makes it possible to re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct their tra@@ jec@@ tor@@ ies .
there is also a mag@@ ne@@ tic field inside each dete@@ ctor .
this hel@@ ps dete@@ ct and study the tra@@ jec@@ tor@@ ies of the char@@ ged partic@@ les , such as the elec@@ tr@@ on or the pro@@ ton , which are sensi@@ tive to the mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
another de@@ vice is a cal@@ ori@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ be@@ aring tra@@ ck dete@@ ctor .
some cal@@ ori@@ me@@ ters stop partic@@ les like ph@@ ot@@ ons or elec@@ tr@@ ons , while some are designed to stop neu@@ tr@@ ons and ph@@ ot@@ ons .
they measure the energy lost by the partic@@ les that pen@@ et@@ rate them .
help from the st@@ r@@ ings
how can the nature of basic partic@@ les be defined beyond the mechanisms pre@@ si@@ ding over their creation ?
be@@ sides the standard model of partic@@ le physi@@ cs – resulting from the pos@@ tu@@ lations of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ics – con@@ temporary sci@@ ence has pin@@ ned its hop@@ es on the to@@ tally new uni@@ fying no@@ tion provided by the highly ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical st@@ ring the@@ ory .
this introduc@@ es the prospe@@ ct of to@@ tally new kin@@ ds of experi@@ ments at C@@ ER@@ N .
the standard model – the ke@@ y@@ st@@ one of moder@@ n physi@@ cs , pa@@ in@@ s@@ tak@@ ingly put in place during the 20@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y – considers ele@@ mentary partic@@ les to be points gover@@ ned by three of the fundamental intera@@ ctions recognised between the partic@@ les : elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ net@@ ism , and the strong and we@@ ak for@@ ces .
this allow@@ s us to offer a description that f@@ its very well with what happens in this world of the in@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly small .
this model , however , does not take into account the f@@ our@@ th intera@@ ction - gra@@ vity .
now , in qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m physi@@ cs , just as light pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ tes itself with the help of a partic@@ le , the ph@@ ot@@ on , gra@@ vita@@ tional intera@@ ction must be trans@@ mitted with the help of another partic@@ le , the gra@@ vit@@ on .
in search of uni@@ fication
there is an ob@@ sta@@ cle , therefore , to the description of such a partic@@ le by the standard model ( see box ) .
moreover , at the beginning , the Uni@@ verse was both extre@@ mely small and extre@@ mely mas@@ sive ( all energy and matter were concentra@@ ted into a very small volume ) .
consequ@@ ently , there too , a the@@ ory to descri@@ be the partic@@ les that pre@@ domin@@ ated during that period cannot leave gra@@ vity as@@ ide .
how , then , to integra@@ te into all this the the@@ ory of general rela@@ tivity – proposed by E@@ inste@@ in at the beginning of the last cen@@ tur@@ y – which re@@ vol@@ ves enti@@ rely around gra@@ vi@@ tation ?
“ The uni@@ fication of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ics and the the@@ ory of general rela@@ tivity has become the real Hol@@ y Gra@@ il for physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts .
ar@@ mi@@ es of sci@@ en@@ tis@@ ts are working on the issue .
the most pro@@ mis@@ ing p@@ ath seems to be st@@ ring the@@ ory . ”
from points to st@@ r@@ ings
what does this the@@ ory tell us about our world ?
first , it views partic@@ les not as points but as elements that can be compared to extre@@ mely small st@@ r@@ ings , in the order of 10@@ -@@ 35 me@@ ters long ( 1 p@@ rece@@ ded by 35 zer@@ o@@ es , the first being to the left of the deci@@ mal point ) .
these st@@ r@@ ings vi@@ b@@ rate and the manner in which they vi@@ b@@ rate correspon@@ ds to different types of partic@@ le .
the more a st@@ ring vi@@ bra@@ tes , the more ener@@ ge@@ tic its corresponding partic@@ le .
one of the proper@@ ties of st@@ ring the@@ ory that is necessary for its ma@@ the@@ matic consisten@@ cy is super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
to understand what this is , a short explan@@ ation of the ‘ z@@ o@@ ol@@ ogy ’ of ele@@ mentary partic@@ les is needed .
qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m bodies in the uni@@ verse can be di@@ vi@@ ded into two famili@@ es : on the one hand , there are the fer@@ mi@@ ons which include elec@@ tr@@ ons and quar@@ ks ; on the other , there is the family known as b@@ os@@ ons , which include the medi@@ ating partic@@ les of fundamental intera@@ ctions such as the ph@@ ot@@ on , which direc@@ ts elec@@ tr@@ o - mag@@ ne@@ tic for@@ ces , and the gra@@ vit@@ on , mentioned above , for gra@@ vi@@ tation .
the super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try issue
super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try consis@@ ts of the sup@@ position that each partic@@ le in the fer@@ mi@@ on family correspon@@ ds to a partic@@ le bel@@ on@@ ging to the Bos@@ on family , and vice ver@@ sa , h@@ ence the idea of sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
no super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c partic@@ le has yet been dis@@ covered , but partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts hope to see them in high-@@ energy col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons , which they will soon produce using the L@@ H@@ C , the new partic@@ le ac@@ cele@@ ra@@ tor at C@@ ER@@ N .
in the mean@@ time , as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers might indirec@@ tly obser@@ ve the effects of these my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous partic@@ les , since the total mass of the g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies and g@@ ala@@ x@@ y c@@ lus@@ ters seems much greater than the lu@@ min@@ ous mass ( star@@ s , gas , etc ) dete@@ cted by as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers &apos; tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
they therefore pos@@ tu@@ late the existence of an in@@ visi@@ ble dar@@ k matter that only intera@@ cts with the rest of matter by its gra@@ vi@@ tation , and consis@@ ts of very sta@@ ble , and therefore very light , partic@@ les .
there are many fea@@ tures sha@@ red with the ligh@@ test of super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c partic@@ les .
these could , therefore , be the un@@ known constitu@@ ents of dar@@ k matter , the effects of which were first observed by the S@@ w@@ iss as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer F@@ rit@@ z Z@@ w@@ ick@@ y in 19@@ 33 .
four intera@@ ctions , from one single intera@@ ction
another question pu@@ zz@@ ling sci@@ en@@ tis@@ ts concerns nature &apos;s four fa@@ m@@ ous fundamental intera@@ ctions .
why are their streng@@ ths so different from each other ?
the streng@@ th of gra@@ vita@@ tional intera@@ ction is , for example , much we@@ ak@@ er than that of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic intera@@ ction .
pro@@ of of this is that the mag@@ net@@ ism from a single mag@@ net is sufficient to pull a rela@@ tively large me@@ tal@@ lic mass while an entire plan@@ et is required to move the same mass using gra@@ vity .
one answer to this question is that all fundamental intera@@ ctions were just one intera@@ ction at the extre@@ mely high energi@@ es which pre@@ va@@ iled at the beginning of the uni@@ verse .
